He publishes a novel with the same title, containing the same words in the same order. But, as Borges shows you, the different cultural context means it's a completely new book! What was once trite and commonplace is now daring and new, and vice versa. It just happens to look like Cervantes's masterpiece.Similarly, imagine the man who was brave or stupid enough to rewrite DuneThere's a characteristically witty essay by Borges about a man who rewrites Don Quixote, many centuries after Cervantes. He publishes a novel with the same title, containing the same words in the same order. But, as Borges shows you, the different cultural context means it's a completely new book! What was once trite and commonplace is now daring and new, and vice versa. It just happens to look like Cervantes's masterpiece.Similarly, imagine the man who was brave or stupid enough to rewrite Dune in the early 21st century. Like many people who grew up in the 60s and 70s, I read the book in my early teens. What an amazing story! Those kick-ass Fremen! All those cool, weird-sounding names and expressions they use! (They even have a useful glossary in the back). The disgusting, corrupt, slimy Harkonnens - don't you just love to hate them! When former-aristo-turned-desert-guerilla-fighter Paul Muad'Dib rides in on a sandworm at the end to fight the evil Baron and his vicious, cruel nephew, of course you're cheering for him. Who the hell wouldn't be?So that was the Dune we know and love, but the man who rewrote it now would get a rather different reception. Oh my God! These Fremen, who obviously speak Arabic, live on a desert planet which supplies the Universe with melange, a commodity essential to the Galactic economy, and in particular to transport. Not a very subtle way to say ""oil""! They are tough, uncompromising fighters, who are quite happy to use suicide bombing as a tactic. They're led by a charismatic former rich kid (OK, we get who you mean), who inspires them to rise up against the corrupt, degenerate... um, does he mean Westerners? Or only the US? And who is Baron Harkonnen intended to be? I'm racking my brains... Dubya doesn't quite seem to fit, but surely he means someone? Unless, of course, he's just a generic stereotype who stands for the immoral, sexually obsessed West. This is frightening. What did we do to make Frank al-Herbert hate us so much? You'd have people, not even necessarily right-wingers, appearing on TV to say that the book was dangerous, and should be banned: at the very least, it incites racial hatred, and openly encourages terrorism. But translations would sell brilliantly in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, and a bad movie version would soon be made in Turkey.I honestly don't think Herbert meant any of that; but today, it's almost impossible not to wonder. If anyone reading this review is planning to rewrite The Tale of Benjamin Bunny, you'd better make sure you get your timing right. Who knows how it will be interpreted five years from now?...more"

Frank Herbert was as important to the genre as Isaac Asimov and Arthur Clarke. Unfortunately, just like them, he's quite dated, and his books can be a labor to read. One thing he maintained from old science fiction was prim and scientific dialogue that no one would ever actually speak. I've known many scientists, and they don't talk like this. You're not goingNo one should argue the importance Dune. It laid the foundations for a great deal of the themes and constructs in modern science fiction. Frank Herbert was as important to the genre as Isaac Asimov and Arthur Clarke. Unfortunately, just like them, he's quite dated, and his books can be a labor to read. One thing he maintained from old science fiction was prim and scientific dialogue that no one would ever actually speak. I've known many scientists, and they don't talk like this. You're not going to convince me a child does.The stuffy dialogue is inserted into even stuffier narrative, until it feels like nothing is organic about Herbert's prose. This is a terrible tragedy when you've got a world that he put so much effort into building - and it is an amazing feat of world-building, technically interplanetary building. But unlike J.R.R. Tolkien, who he is so frequently compared to, Herbert didn't make sure to include a great story in his world. Instead he included a story that frequently illustrated how clunky an artificial world can be, even if it's lovingly crafted. I struggled to attach or find interest in anyone, yet they're more archetypes than human beings, whose logic races past modern skepticism and whose dialogue is cloyingly artificial, the way people cared for the Hobbits, Dwarves and Rangers. In his world-building, Tolkien at least saved himself from being dated by antedating himself, and even with his illuminated prose, wrought more characteristics in just one protagonist than all of Dune's cast. Even the political intrigue Herbert tries to fall back on was overdone in the Spy genre decades before he started this book. All fans of the ""Genre"" genres should appreciate Herbert's massive contributions, but they shouldn't pretend to enjoy the books if they don't, and they should be wary of certain pitfalls typical of science fiction that survived into his landmark work....more"

It is to convince YOU to read this book. Yes, you! Waste time no more. Go grab a copy.Machiavellian intrigue, mythology, religion, politics, imperialism, environmentalism, the nature of power. All this set in a mind-boggling, frighteningly original world which Herbert ominously terms as an ""effort at prediction"". Dune had me hooked!First impressionThe very first stirring I felt upon opening the yellowed pages of Dune was that of stumbling upon an English translation of an ancient Arabic manuscript of undeniable power and potence which had an epic story to narrate. The tone was umistakably sombre and I realized Herbert was not here to merely entertain me, he was here to make me part of the legend of Muad'Dib. It was intriguing and challenging and heck, since I live for challenges I decided to take this one up too, gladly. The challenge was the complexity and depth of the plot, which left me perplexed, in the beginning. I knew there were dialogues which meant much more than their superficial meaning and was unable to grasp at it. I felt a yawning chasm between Herbert's vision and my limited understanding of it. However, of course, I plodded on and could feel the gap closing in with every page much to my joy and relief. The Foreword""To the people whose labours go beyond ideas into the realm of 'real materials'- to the dry-land ecologists, wherever they may be, in whatever time they work, this effort at prediction is dedicated in humility and admiration."" The foreword makes it pretty clear that Frank Herbert isn't kidding around. This is a serious effort at predicting how our world is going to look two thousand years from now and by God, it's a bloody good and detailed prediction. However, the real merit in this effort lies in the commentary on our lives in the present.Why Frank Herbert is a geniusThe setting of the book is arid futuristic. the plot is driven by political mindgames reminiscent of The Game of Thrones. The issues he tackles are as modern as the colour television. Herbert's genius manifests itself in his ability to combine the past, the present and the future in one sweeping elegant move called Dune.Plot and SettingDune is set in a futuristic technologically advanced world which after the Butlerian Jihad (the bloody war between Man and Machines) has eliminated all computers and passed a decree declaring ""Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man's mind"". Since there are no computers, the essential working of the galaxy is still medieval and feudal with heavy reliance on men and their dallying around. Lots of thriller potential right there. Men with superhuman analytical abilities called Mentats have taken the place of Computers. On the other hand, we have the Bene Gesserit, an ancient school of mental and physical training for female students (it gives them superhuman intuitive powers) who follow a selective breeding program which makes them feared and mistrusted through the Imperium. Their desired end product of this breeding program is the Kwisatz Haderach, a superman whoâll be able to glimpse into the future. How heâll be able to do this is rooted in Herbertâs idea of determinism: given that one can observe everything and analyze everything, one can effectively glimpse the future in probabilistic terms. Quantum physics anyone? The Kwisatz Haderach is the proposed solution to the male-female dichotomy, between the analytical and intuitive.The plot of Dune is almost wholly set on the desert planet of Arrakis (also referred to as Dune), an arid wasteland where water is so scarce that men have to wear stillsuits which recycle human moisture for further consumption. The source of the galaxyâs interest in the planet is Melange, a spice which bestows upon one longevity and prescient powers. Everything on the planet is permeated with the spice, the air, the sand, the food. Everybody on the planet is hopelessly addicted to the spice, their only hope for survival being their continued intake of the spice. The Spacing Guild, the economic and trading monopolistic arm of the Galaxy badly needs the spice for interstellar transport. This is because their frigates travel faster than the speed of light and hence travel backward in time. The spice is the only way they can look into the future and see their way ahead. How cool is that! All the powers on the Galaxy are out to mine the spice, braving the sandworms, their name merely an euphemism, for they are gigantic 200 metre long creatures which always come digging through the sand whenever spice mining is undertook. Always. Thereâs also another little glitch. There exist on the planet, the kickass native desert tribal Fremen, whom the foreign powers look down with suspicion and disdain. The Fremen ethos is one of survival and scarcity, driven by tribalism and egalitarianism. Okay, Iâll stop right there. No more spoilers about this. Except that they value water to the extent that spitting on a person is the highest honour they can bestow upon him.Our protagonists are the Atreides family, consisting of the Duke, his Bene Gesserit concubine Jessica and their son Paul, who have been entrusted the stewardship of Arrakis. We discover the alien planet of Arrakis along with them, firstly with fear, suspicion and wonder and ultimately, love and respect. Paul MuadâDib, however is no ordinary prince. Thereâs a teeny weeny chance he might be the Kwisatz Haderach, something which troubles him constantly and gives us our conflicted hero. The poor chap trips balls over the spice and has visions of black hordes pillaging and murdering around town bearing his flag and sees his dead body multiple times.My favourite character, however has to be the Baron Vladmir Harkonnen, the most evil character Iâve ever come across in my literary excursions. He is ruddy ruthlessness, he is virile villainy, he is truculent treachery. He executes the inept chess players in his employ which says oodles about his badassery and his fondness for cold-blooded logic. He sees everything in simplistic chess terms. What is my best move? What is my opponentâs best move? Is there anything I can do to completely squash his move? Is there a tactic which leads to mate in three? ThemesIn this setting, Herbert does so much, itâs unbelievable. Religion, politics, the dynamic nature of power, the effects of colonialism, our blatant destruction of our environment are themes which run parallel to the intensely exciting and labyrinthine plot. He shows the paramount importance of myth making and religion for power to sustain over long periods of time. Man, as a political animal is laid completely bare.Real lifeNow these are my thoughts about what Herbert could have meant to be Arrakis-It makes perfect sense. Herbert draws heavy inspiration for the religious ideology of MuadâDib from Islam. He says âWhen religion and politics ride in the same cart and that cart is driven by a living Holy man, nothing can stand in the path of such a people.â which is the philosphy of the politics of Islam. Islamism in a nutshell. The spice, much desired by everyone, is the oil. Baron Vladmir Harkonnen is symblomatic of the wily Russians. The Desert foxes Fremen are representative of the native Saudi desert-dwelling Bedouin tribe who have a strongly tribe-oriented culture and undoubtedly value water in equal measure. And the ultimate loser is the environment.Why do good books get over?I almost forget this is a science fiction novel, itâs that real. It is also scary and prophetic. It is a reading experience that will leave you dreaming of the grave emptiness of Arrakis and make you wish you were there to brave it all in the privileged company of the noble Fremen. Frank Herbert achieves the pinnacle of what a sci-fi author aspires to rise to; authentic world building....more"

I will admit there are some things that went over my head but for the most part I figured it out. I remember a billion and 65 years ago I watched the movie and was like what the? Basically all I remember is Sting and sandworms. I would love to watch it again and see if I understand it more after reading the book. I'm still not sure what all the spices were about on Arrakis. I keep thinking it's like their farming like we would farm corn or tobacco, etc. I could be wrong and I didn't get the connection between the spice and the sandworms. Is it like a drug to them? I did read in the back of the book that is was like a drug when taken in small quantities and really addictive when taken in large quantities and that Muad'Did felt his prophesies were because of the spice. I liked Duke Leto and I hated that he was betrayed not long after they got to Arrakis. There is always some twat out there causing trouble. I really enjoyed Paul's character and his mother Jessica. They seemed like really strong people and adapted very well in everything they were put through. I didn't really pay too much attention to the other characters or I guess I should say I didn't have many thoughts about them. With the exception of the ones that betrayed them. I really enjoyed when Paul and Jessica had to travel to get away from the evil Baron Harkonnen before they were killed too. I don't know why, but I enjoyed their little journey. I think they were both great in their roles when they were found by the Freman and showed they were a force to be reckoned with. Now maybe I'm getting this all wrong but I'm trying to tell it through the way I saw it in my mind. I don't understand how Paul's sister, Alia, was an abomination. That one must have went over my head too. It might have had something to do with the poison Jessica took to become the Reverend Mother. I'm not sure but I know some of my goodreads friends that read this will get me sorted out =)Other than the sandworms and traitorous people on Arrakis, I was most freaked out by the thought of the water issue! I would NOT was to live somewhere there was a water shortage. And the part where they were talking about selling foot water, I can't even. Which basically means your stinky foot sweat! Overall I really liked the book. I enjoyed traipsing through this desert with Paul and his mother. Only in book form though, not in real life! Since they are doing re-makes of about a million different movies, I wish they would re-make this one because I think it would be really awesome! I would like to see this land come to life in today's time! I don't know if I'm going to continue with the series as I have heard this is the best one and the others get confusing. But I would like to see how Paul is as a ruler and what all happens to them, or maybe not depending on what all happens. If anyone can answer any of the things I was confused with that would be helpful =)Also, I have seen some pictures on here of this really cool Dune book with art in it. Does anyone have a link of where to get that book or is it still available? Thank you :-)MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List...more

I could never give Dune five stars because I really struggled to get into the novel in the beginning. It has taken me almost two months to read. This, for me, is a very long time to spend on a book. It took me so long to read because I found the writing style incredibly frustrating. I had to read whole chapters again so I could get the gist of the plot. This was more so in the beginning, which I found particularly hard to read because of the authorâs way of shifting between the thoughts of multiple characters. I found this very annoying; however, I persevered over my initial despondency towards the writing, and plodded on through the book. Iâm glad I did so because in the end I did come to really enjoy it. Indeed, the story is fantastic, but the writing will always remain unbearable for me.  A truly brilliant plot Dune is to science fiction what The Lord of the Rings is to high fantasy; it is the novel that officially, and unarguably, defines the genre. The story begins with the house of Atreides accepting the Dukedom of the planet Dune. The former Baron has been ousted by the Emperor, and is no longer of consequence. Well, that is how it initially appears. Very early on it revealed that the whole thing is a political ploy to bring the house of Atreides to its knees. The Baron lies in wait, and is ready to strike against the new, and benevolent, approach the Duke uses on the Fremen. The Fremen are the natives of the dessert planet; thus, they know how to survive its harshness above all others. They do this through their frugal approach to water. They value it above all else, and will never waste a drop in earnest. The Baron Harkonnen, as a chide against the natives, squanders water in the cruellest ways. He, and his dinner guests, throw cups of water on the floor of the dinner hall; it was his tradition. The wasted water was soaked up with towels, which the Baron allowed the Fremen to suck the water out of. When the Duke enters he rejects this custom, and is more respectful to the Fremen way of life. He and his son and heir Paul, who is the protagonist of this novel, go as far as to try the Fremenâs grossly effective water saving suits. These Stillsuits, quite literally, recycle all the water the body wastes and feeds it back to its wearer. The Fremen way is the right wayThis early familiarity, with the Fremen technology, no doubt helps to keep Paulâs mind open when he is later forced to live amongst the Fremen. Paul is somewhat of a marvel; he is prophecyâs chosen one. When he eventually gains the trust of the Fremen they allow him to choose a Fermen name. He calls himself after their most revered prophet: Muad'Dib. They accept this and follow him as their leader. His inherited title of Duke dictates that he is their lord, but their religion determines their real loyalty. He has to, quite literally, fight for every ounce of their trust. Indeed, it does not come cheap, and will only be given to one who is a member of their people. âWithout change something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens. The sleeper must awaken.âThus, Paul becomes their saviour. Consequently, he receives heaps of character development through this book. He goes form boy to the revered leader of a nation. The Fremen, like Paul, want the evil Baron Harkonnen gone from their planet. They do no want a cruel oppressor who is ignorant to their ways: they want Paul. I think the imagination behind the Fremen culture really is wonderful. They have efficiently adapted to survive their harsh planet. To emphasise this point you need only look at the fact that off-world humans live in fear of the giant Sandworms that infect the planet whereas the Fremen ride them as a coming of age ritual. Indeed, Paul has to ride a worm if the Fremen are to follow him. Deep characters The result of this is a very complex, and intriguing plot. I found the first third of this book to be very perplexing initially. This is a world we are told about rather than shown at the start. We hear about the Fremen but do not truly understand them till the very end. I was very overwhelmed at the beginning, and in all honesty I do think this novel merits a re-read to further establish my understanding of it. This did affect my rating because it inhibited by enjoyment of the book. âDeep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.âIndeed, aside from Paul there is a whole host of dynamic, and well rounded, characters. His mother is to be the new revered mother of the Fremen people, which for someone of her age is quite remarkable. There is also the captain of Duke Letoâs household guard who is a very deep and honourable individual. As much as I came to like these characters I was still frustrated with the writing of them in the beginning. I found it difficult to read scenes in which up to four characters internal thoughts are portrayed alongside their dialogue. It wasnât always clear who was thinking. I much prefer a narrative that is focalised through one person. Well, at least one person per chapter. Overall, I thought the idea behind this novel was utterly fantastic. However, my personal reaction to the writing style limited my overall enjoyment of the book. I do intend to read some of the sequels. However, I do not have any intention of doing so in the near future. Maybe, in a couple of years I will return to the brilliant, and annoyingly written, world of Dune.Postscript: I thought |Iâd show of some more pictures of my beautiful folio society edition of Dune. Also, all of the pictures (except the first) in my review are from the artwork in this edition. Enjoy! ...more

Like a study of Shakespeare, the reader finds that this is an archetype upon which many influences and imitators have based their works. The complexity and depth of the creation is staggering and I am continually astounded at the discipline with which Herbert must have focused his imagination.This is the book upon which Herbert would base his greatest series and one that would outlive him as his son has continued to expand and add detail to the vast, immaculate tapestry woven by a true master of the genre. Encapsulating political, economic, sociological, biological, cultural and dynastic themes, Frank Herbert has set a high standard for later practitioners.Brilliant.***2015 reread - Read years later, this has lost none of its narrative power, if anything I can better appreciate the virtuoso attention to detail Herbert exhibited in his epic creation. From the perspective of having read his later 5 Dune sequels, I am astounded at the rich tapestry he has woven. Most impressive was his close omnipresence, analyzing the thoughts and minute actions and subtle nuances of his complicated dynamic interplay of characters. The exhaustive training of the Bene Gesserit and the intricate relations of the Houses and the Guild would stand as a monumental benchmark for speculative fiction ever since.This time around I found myself looking more closely at the Harkonnens and will likely read some of Brian Herbert's additions to his fathers great work...more

Number 13. :) I cry when Paul meets Gurney. I shiver when Jessica consoles Chani. I'm awestruck by the peaks and troughs of time, free-will, and the weakness in Paul even as he heroically strives against the evil that is about to be unleashed upon the universe. *sigh*Perfection. Easily the number one book I've ever read. :)I waver, sometimes, but right now, it is my absolute favorite. :)Original Review:This is a phenomenal classic of literature.It's not just science fiction. It transcends science fiction, as a fascinating discussion of free-will versus inevitability. Can the Jihad be denied? Can Paul ever really avoid his own death, despite seeing every time-line play out with him as the butt of every cosmic joke? Can even cruelty or mercy even remain comprehensible after such knowledge?Yes, I think this work outdoes Nietzsche. It certainly does a great job of making us care about the question.Is this all? Is this just a work that pays great justice to philosophy of action and inaction? Or is the novel merely a clever play at turning the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle into the physical embodiment of a man? It is that, of course. The Kwisatz Haderach can be many places at once, and he can be both alive and dead at the same time just like that certain cat.Is the novel a coming of age tale, first set as a mirror against his father Leto, only then to mirror the whole universe that had just turned against him? Yes, of course. He was, after all, both the product of all his upbringing and his genes, embodying the question of nature versus nurture. He was taught within many schools of martial arts and assassins, as well as training the mind in both the schools of the Mentats with their pure logic and that of the mystics, the Bene Gesserit, that allows complete control over the body down to the cellular level. And if this training wasn't enough, he was deeply schooled in politics, leadership, and the meaning of loyalty. The boy was raised right. Of course, that is nothing without ninety generations of genetic bloodline tampering from the Bene Gesserit, right? To become the fulcrum between cellular memory, tapping the minds and lives of all your genetic ancestors as well as tapping the ability to fold time and space, to become the eye of a storm of time.What a damn brilliant setup for one tiny character, no? His training links to the unlocking of his genes and to the life-extending and enveloping spice, Melange, to make him not merely aware of time in a theoretical sense, but eventually to be unable to discern what was in the past, the present, or the future. Here's a true Super-Man, well beyond Nietzsche.And don't believe for one second that this serious discussion about what would make a superior man makes for dull reading. No. We've got PLOT that's probably some of the most exciting and visceral in all of literature, driving us right into the web of intrigue, vengeance, treachery, and galactic politics. To quote the text, we've got ""Plans within Plans,"" and it hardly stops there. We know the House Atreides is falling into a trap laid by the Emperor and House Harkonnen, and yet free-will and pride prevents any chance to avoid it. The setup is brilliant and extremely political, giving us character sketches of some of the most brilliant and memorable characters of all time.Duke Leto, the Red Duke, the most honorable and beloved leader.Duncan Idaho, the emotional and intuitive hero.Gurney Halleck, archetypal loyalist and troubadour.Lady Jessica, the woman who ought to have had all honor in life, but was unjustly reviled and set aside for political necessity. (Chani being both her mirror and her eventual glory.)And of course, my favorite character of all time, Paul Muad'dib Atreides, the one that would prevent the greater evils he foresaw, and went to enormous lengths and sacrifice to achieve, but who eventually failed in his task because even a god cannot overcome destiny. (Or the will of so many minds set as one.)So damn brilliant.Frank Herbert spent five years writing this treasure, working and reworking it until he published it at age 25. None of his other works come close to this masterpiece, and there's little wonder. It was birthed, fully-formed, like Athena from Zeus's head, with enormous forethought and care. The worldbuilding was just as carefully formed, from the ecology of Arrakis and the life-cycles of the sandworms, to the history and the creation of the Fremen from their mild beginnings as Zensunni Wanderers, adherents to the Orange Catholic Bible, to their history of oppression so like those of those who are Jewish, to their settling and hardening of their bodies and souls in the wastes of Arrakis, also just like the Jewish who carved out a place for themselves in Israel. (Current politics aside, this was a very potent idea before 1965 when Herbert wrote this, and indeed, the core is still just as powerful when you turn it back to Muslims.)The Galactic culture is rich and detailed. The CHOAM economic consortium, with their monopoly on space travel and their need for the Spice to allow them to see a short period into the future to plot a safe course before folding space. The Empire is caught on a knife's edge between a single power and every other House who sit in the possibility of putting aside all their squabbles for the sole purpose of checking the Emperor, if they so desired. (And Duke Atreides was such a possible popular leader among all the Great Houses, which was the primary reason the Emperor wanted him dead.) And of course, we have our Villains. The Baron Harkonnen has always been a crowd pleaser. Brilliant in his own right, devious and able to corrupt anyone with just the right sorts of pressure, including a certain absolutely trustworthy doctor we might mention.""The Tooth! The Tooth!"" -- You can't handle the Tooth!Feyd Rautha Harkonnen is especially interesting for the question of nature versus nurture.The Bene Gesserit had intended him to mate with Paul, who should have been Leto and Jessica's daughter, and that offspring should have been the cumulation of ninety years of a breeding experiment to recreate the Kwisatz Haderach which had come about almost by accident during the Butlerian Jihad in the deep past, to overthrow the AI overlords.He was practically Paul's genetic twin, or at least, his potential to be the ""One who can be many places at once"" was on par with Paul. But instead of fulfilling the kind of destiny that we get with Paul, we see him grow up under the auspices of his Uncle the Baron, becoming as cruel and devious as he was deadly. He was the argument of nurture in the conversation, of course, and having so very little of it eventually cost him his life.I often wonder about the directions that Dune could have taken, all those little paths in time and circumstance that could have been. What if Feyd had been brought to Arrakis earlier and overwhelmed with Spice the way that Paul had? Sure, he wouldn't have been able to convert the unconscious changes into conscious manipulation, but he might have had enough glimpses of the future, the way that the Fremen did, to have given him the edge he would have needed to kill Paul.And then there's a relatively minor character, Hasimir Fenring, the Emperor's personal assassin, who was nearly the Kwisatz Haderach, himself. Unable to breed true, he was still potent enough to be completely hidden to Paul's time-sight in the same way that Paul was hidden from the Spacing Guild's weaker time-sight. His training as a skilled killer was also superior to Paul. He was, by all the hints and tricks in the tale, Paul's perfect downfall. It always gives me shivers to think about, and it was only in a single instant of both recognition and pity from Paul that stayed Fenring from killing our hero. It was just a moment of whim.The setup was gorgeous. Paul's pity, had it been missing at his moment of greatest triumph over the Emperor, would have meant Paul's assured death. I still wonder, to this day, what stayed Frank Herbert's hand from killing his most wonderful darling. We knew the pressure of religion and politics was going to have its way upon all the oppressed peoples of Dune. The return of a monstrous religious Jihad was going to happen one way or another, sweeping across the galaxy and toppling the Empire, regardless of Paul's frantic plans and desires. Paul's own death would only mean a higher level of fanaticism, and Frank Herbert's warning against unreasoning devotion would have been made even clearer with Paul's death.Perhaps it was pity that stayed his hand. Who are we to say who lives and who dies?If you really think this review is overlong, then I apologize, but please understand that I could absolutely go on and on much longer than this. It is a symptom of my devotion to this most brilliant of all tales.And yes, it still holds up very, very well after twelve reads. I am quite shocked and amazed....more"

Herbert created a vast and complex system of ancient spatial politics and peoples, then set them at one another's throats over land, money, and drugs.Dune is often said to relate to Sci Fi in the same way that Tolkien relates to Fantasy. I'd say that, as far as paradigm shift, this is widely true. Both entered genres generally filled with the odd, childish, and ridiculous and injected a literary sensibility which affected all subsequent authors.Few will challenge the importance of Star Wars' effect on film and storytelling in general, but without Dune, there would be no Star Wars. Princess Alia, the desert planet, the Spice, the Bene Gesserit, and Leto II all have direct descendants in the movies. It is unfortunate that Lucas seems to have forgotten in these later years that his best genius was pilfered from Herbert, Campbell, and Kurosawa.Though I have heard that the later books do not capture the same eclectic energy as the first, Dune itself is simply one of the most original and unusual pieces of Sci Fi ever written. Read it, Starship Troopers, Ringworld, Neuromancer, and Snowcrash and you'll know everything you need to about Sci Fi: that you want more....more

I never did pick up the classic sci-fi book, assuming the commentary heard about the movie applied to the book. All that changed when I broke my finger and found myself with a lot of extra time on my hands (groan).Besides, sandworms.Dune has a lot of ingredients that donât fit into my preferred stories, yet the gestalt was not only tolerable, but engrossing. It begins with the Atreides family preparing to shift their holding from their current home to the planet of Arrakis. The Emperor has given the Atreides the territory and trade on the planet of Arrakis, formerly under control of their enemies, the Harkonnen. The planet Arrakis is hot, arid and generally hostile to life. There is, however, a small population of native, fierce Freman who have managed to build an existence in the desert.Paul Atreides is the young heir of the family, and mystical testing reveals he might be the one prophesied.Paul undergroes a rapid growth curve, facilitated by his teacher Dr. Yeuh and his fatherâs advisors.But it is in the desert that Paul will discover his strength as well as his new people.Seriously, now.Honestly, I have to wonder how much of this like is generational. If Sanderson or Rothfuss wrote this book, two chapters in Dune would have made a whole book, and while detail may have been added, it likely would have made for a book as slow as the movie. I liked the scope of Dune, and that there is a resolution to the initial conflict. It is also interesting that despite the volume of concepts packed in here, with political maneuvers, terraforming, technology, cultural assimilation, and mysticism all playing roles that I didnât find it overwhelming, perhaps because so much is genre-familiar. On the downside, it could have perhaps used a bit more transitions, particularly near the end when months at a time are skipped. Writing was solid; nothing really stood out, but it told the story well. Thereâs some vague mysticism that might irritate those who like explanations. It was a bit of an eye-roller to have the chief villain be a fat, gay, sadistic pedophile, but Herbert really isnât thinking outside the trope character box much (itâs not enough that he sentences people to death but he has to be physically abhorrent? And gay?). World-building is fun, but standard desert.Overall, Iâm glad that I finally took the time to read it and put those old assumptions to rest. I love a good hero....more
23505468	234225	2008-06-02	5	Like most of my five star books, Iâve read Dune multiple times. In fact, Iâd say that what makes a book more than just enjoyable and instead truly amazing is that you want to read it more than once and are rewarded for doing so. Iâve probably read Dune six times, and Iâve never gotten tired of it but my understanding of the work has increased over time.To begin with, the first time I read Dune, I got about three pages into it, realized I didnât understand a thing and that I was hopelessly confusLike most of my five star books, Iâve read Dune multiple times. In fact, Iâd say that what makes a book more than just enjoyable and instead truly amazing is that you want to read it more than once and are rewarded for doing so. Iâve probably read Dune six times, and Iâve never gotten tired of it but my understanding of the work has increased over time.To begin with, the first time I read Dune, I got about three pages into it, realized I didnât understand a thing and that I was hopelessly confused. I had to go back and reread what I had read, and then go back again and reread the whole chapter. I would excuse myself by saying that I was 10, but Iâm sure Iâm not the only one that has had that experience. Donât be dismayed if it happens to you - whether 10, 18, or 45. If you are confused at first, consider that Paul is also confused and finds so much that happens strange and new. Understanding will come in its proper time.At one time at least, there was a fairly famous website (at least among geeks) that humorously summarized books in thirty words or less. Maybe it still exists, but its name escapes me. The summary provided for Dune read something like this, âIâm Frank Herbert and Iâm a lot smarter than you are.â When I was younger, this would have seemed a fair appraisal of the work. One of the most central aspects of âDuneâ is Herbert manages to write convincingly about people whose intelligence is supposed to vastly exceed that of the reader. More than anything, to create a believable Messianic story, the writer has to create a Messiah possessing believable Messianic wisdom and insight, and Herbert succeeds at this invention probably better than any other writer. We come to believe that the protagonists do have deep and profound insight into the question of âLife, the Universe, and Everythingâ so that we do not immediately feel cheated and we are able to believe in the characters â even someone like MaudâDib. As Iâve gotten older, and hopefully wiser, Iâve come to see that Herbert is not in fact possessed of superhuman intelligence, but that he creates the illusion of superhuman intelligence by a variety of clever devices. The appearance of a superhuman intelligence and wisdom is really a sham and the pool is really pretty shallow, but even this revelation does not reduce the esteem in which I hold the work. Itâs not Herbertâs real job to be a prophet: heâs an artist. Herbert succeeds brilliantly in what he should be judged on â the ability to paint the illusion deftly and convincingly. If we acquire the sophistication to see through it, it shouldnât reduce our appreciation of the artistic mastery used in creating it. I think now I would amend the summary of the work to be, âIâm Frank Herbert, and Iâm a lot better writer than you are.âIf all that could be said in Duneâs favor was that it had one of the most convincing invented prophets in literature, it would still be a worthwhile work. But Dune has abundant pleasures beyond the richly realized illusion of philosophical depth and even the deftly realized setting. Chief among these for me is the truly deep and intricate relationships Paul has with the other characters. There is a real depth of feeling here, and I love the way each of the complicated nuanced relationships is portrayed as we are introduced to the cast of Paulâs complicated life. Each character feels a deep mixture of feelings for Paul who is boy, man, friend, soldier, sovereign, and Messiah and much else. There is tenderness to this work. We sense that complexity and tenderness right from the start, when his mother allows him to be tortured and to face murder, and then immediately thereafter experiences profound hope and joy: âMy son lives.â We feel Paulâs boyish love for his friends and companions, who are also his fatherâs henchmen and his teachers and who he is in turn their future Lord. We feel the more mature manly love that these companions have for their young charge and future ruler. Even Yueh loves the boy he must destroy. We feel the boyish admiration Paul has for his father as he strains to be worthy of him and to make his father proud, and we feel the returned pride and satisfaction that his father feels. We feel the aching love of a boy for this Mother when he has already lost everything else when Jessica is buried in sand, and we feel her returned love when she says, âI knew you would find me.âAnd though there love is only briefly on stage, still I find the love between Paul and Chani among the sweetest and most charming in literature. Who cannot thrill when scarcely knowing each other, but seeing their lives together stretching out before them both good and terrible, the young becoming but not yet lovers promise with tender vows nonetheless to be forever each other's comfort and joy and they feel their hitherto unseen future becoming a real solid now. Isnât that how it is in some way for all of us when we meet the one who will be the one and we suddenly realize we want to and we will spend the rest of our lives together regardless of what will happen? And how often have we felt the total unabashed joy as Paul does when we know our lover is now near?âThat could only mean Chani was near byâChani, his soul, Chani his sihaya, sweet as the desert spring, Chani up from the palmaries of the deep south.âAll that and âDuneâ is a wonderful exciting action adventure story filled with thrills and chases, fights and battles, and supersized edge of our imagination wonders. Worms.Itâs no wonder that this is one of the best beloved books of all time. If you havenât read it, you should. If you have read it, read it again....more

Itâs also the only place where the precious spice melange can be found so itâs incredibly valuable, and the honorable Duke Leto Atreides has been ordered by the Padishah Emperor to take over control of Arrakis from his mortal enemies, the House Harkonnen. While this seems like a great offer on the surface the Duke and his people realize that itâs actually a cunning trap being set by the Emperor and Baron Harkonnen. The only hope seems to be allying with the local populace called Fremen whose harsh environment has led them to become an incredibly tough and disciplined people, but they have their own vision of what Arrakis should be. They also have a prophecy about the coming of a messiah figure who will lead them to freedom, and the Dukeâs son Paul looks like he may be exactly who theyâve been waiting for.This is classic sci-fi that really deserves the label. What Frank Herbert accomplished in one novel is stunning because he built a fascinatingly detailed universe in which the politics, religion, economics, espionage, and military strategy are all equally important. He then blended these more grounded concepts with bigger sci-fi ideas like being able to use spice to see through space-time, and the scope of that encompasses trying to pick the proper path through various potential timelines as well as free will vs. fate. I think one of the factors that helps this story stay timeless is that so much of it is based on what humanity becomes vs. trying to predict what futuristic technology would be like. This is a society that once had a war with machines and has since rejected any type of computers so people have developed to fill the gap with the help of the spice. The Mentats are trained to use data to predict outcomes. The Navigators of the Guild have used so much of the spice to help them move through space that theyâre mutating. The all female Bene Gesserit have developed a variety of skills to place their members alongside positions of power to help advance their breeding scheme that spans generations. Herbert also cleverly came up with an excuse that explains why knives and hand-to-hand combat are so important with the idea of the personal body shields. So even though we still got a good sci-fiâs novel worth of cool gadgets the emphasis is on what the people can do and how thatâs developed over a long period of time. It also adds a lot of depth to the political dimensions because all of these groups have different agendas that cause them all to mistrust each other, but because they all fill these various roles none can exist with the others.There are also parallels to our world that are still in play because the idea of a desert people caught up in the power struggles of various outsiders because of their valuable natural resource is an obvious allegory to the Middle East that still works today. Plus, the classic film Lawrence of Arabia came out a few years before Herbert published this, and you have to think that it had some influence on him because there are elements of the story that seem very much inspired by it.While the whole concept of a Chosen One has gotten a bit worn over time thatâs not Herbertâs fault, and this is still a fantastic sci-fi story with big ideas that also works as space opera as well as being an epic adventure story....more

Itâs considered by many to be THE best sci-fi novel of all time and Herbertâs son, Brian Herbert, rightfully calls it sci-fiâs equivalent to Lord of the Rings for inspiring all that came after its publication. So, I mean, what in the name of Shai-Hulud am I supposed to add to that?Well, Iâll begin with the story of how I came to read Dune. Iâm sure that there have been ample opportunities to read the book. I can remember seeing the black-spine amidst a forest of other spines on my cousinâs bookshelf, of which I had free reign. Yet something always kept me from picking it up. It could have been my obsession with fantasy novels at that time with only the briefest allowances for sci-fi. Whatever the reason, the book continued to pop up. Its sliver of desert on a black background called to me from piles at used bookstores, the shelves of friends and relatives, and even on public transportation. All the same, I never got around to it.Two factors finally made the difference. The first, my well-read friend (Josh Bragg in real life, but heâs on Goodreads too!) always brought it up as one of the best books heâs ever read. He also took the opportunity to remind me to read it whenever book recommendations went flying between us and, foolishly, I kept putting him off. But Iâm a sucked for a great looking book and these Penguin Galaxy sci-fi collections sealed the deal for me. Their elegant cover designs, the intros by Neil Gaiman, a selection of books Iâd always been meaning to read, AND Dune was on it? I was absolutely delighted to find the book under the tree on Christmas morning and tore into it in earnest. THE TIME HAD FINALLY COMEThough it took near 200 pages to really pick up speed, the novel had me hooked from its immersive opening. Here was a world that was familiar and strange at the same time. There are elements of fantasy and religion coupled with interplanetary travel and space empires. The characters touted titles that were inscrutable at the beginning, but became part of my vocabulary before the novelâs end. The novel refused to tell me everything I needed to understand, secreting mysteries without ever outright stating them. How could I not want to know what Kwisatz Haderach meant? How could I not want to know the secrets of Arrakis? The Layers of DuneI was swept away by this novel that mixes sci-fi concepts of higher dimensions with political intrigue. Environmental change mixed with an unlimited cast of enthralling characters, and a drop of religious philosophy. Dune is a novel of the highest order: it combines entertainment with brilliant questions that pull from an incredible number of disciplines. Of course, if you just want to read a compelling tale of political plotting, murder, adventure, and discovery, you can totally do that too.In the afterword, Brian Herbert notes a conversation he had with his father about the writing and structure of Dune. Frank Herbert constructed Dune so that it would be immensely dense. Herbert wanted to create a tale that could be enjoyed on the level of the central conflict: a boy becoming a man trying to reclaim his heritage against astounding odds in a world beyond imagining. Hereâs an excerpt from that afterword about the layers.Ecology is the most obvious layer, but alongside that are politics, religion, philosophy, history, human evolution, and even poetry. (Pages 693 of the Penguin Galaxy Edition) The fact that the novel can be enjoyed from any number of different readings alone makes it a novel of huge significance. Dune doesnât force you into thinking, but it invites the interested to partake in its rich metaphor and multifaceted meaning. Whatâs more, Herbert makes statements about his concepts, but rarely does he offer them as the only solution (barring, perhaps, an ecological viewpoint that bemoans industrialization). I dove into different fields of thought between and during readings. I contemplated elegant ideas Herbert proposes and marveled at the structure of the plot and the boundless ideas of this world.What a world it is! The world building here could fill a university course as Herbert establishes a world unlike any other, but totally believable. When I read about the stillsuit I was astonished by its creativity, but also how it imparted valuable information about the world of Arrakis. Though the sandworms scream for attention throughout the novel, equal care is given to the hierarchy of the Empire, the mystical Bene Gesserit religion, and the curiosities of culture. Herbert also seems to have invented a group of hallucinogenic compounds that are in equal parts trippy, interesting, and betray an interesting look at 1960s culture.Dune drew me in and took me for a ride that I never wanted to get off.Of course, when the ride does end, it is immensely satisfying. Dune ends leaving unanswered questions in a fashion that made me feel like I knew enough to be entirely contented. Which, of course, begs the question: will I read the other Dune novels? Welllllllllllllllll, maybe. Itâs highly daunting to look at the entire Dune Chronicles and think that I would tackle that. Especially when Dune ends in a way that makes me so happy, and especially when the subsequent novels purportedly deliver diminishing returns. For now, Iâm too overjoyed and impressed by Dune to consider returning to the world anytime soon other than to re-read the novel.Obviously, I canât recommend Dune enough. Thatâs also not a recommendation that goes to the sci-fi crowd alone. Oh no, this is a book that has great appeal to a wide variety of people. You like A Song of Ice and Fire? Perfect: youâll love the backstabbing, the plots-within-plots, the combat, the story. You donât read sci-fi? No worries: thereâs a wealth of important themes upon which to reflect. You like sci-fi, your friends continuously recommend you read Dune, and you keep putting it off?Goodreadians, I think you know what you need to do!...more

One thing I do know: it's a kick-ass read!I've loved this book since I first plunged into it's mightily constructed, weird and obscure world. Of course it's hailed as a classic, and I am one of those that agrees. The sheer magnitude of Herbert's invention, his monumental world-building tied with an exciting story of betrayal, survival, rebellion and ultimate ascendance are more than enough to guarantee that. His characters too, are worthy of note: Paul Atreides the young heir to not only a ducal throne, but the hopes and desires of the oppressed population of an entire planet and the strange otherworldly powers of prescience and command that are his unique birthright; his mother Jessica torn between devotion to her family and her pledge to a generations-long plan spawned by a secret order bent on controlling the universe from behing the scenes; Chani and Stilgar the wild yet honourable representatives of a dangerous people just waiting to burst their chains and explode onto an unsuspecting universe. Add to these heroes the malign Baron Harkonnen and his debased nephews Feyd Rautha and ""the beast"" Rabban, the spiteful and covetous Emperor Shaddam IV, masterminds of the fall of Paul's House, and we have the recipe for an exciting contest of wills with no less than the future of humanity at stake.Even without an exciting story to drive it, the book is almost worth reading just to experience the world created by Herbert. 10,000 years in the future mankind has experience the ""Butlerian Jihad"" wherein all ""thinking machines"" were destroyed and the hatred of the technological has a religious conviction. In their place there are the Mentats, the ""human computers"" able to utilize the human mind to nearly it's full potential, drawing accurate inferences and conclusions with minimal data. There is the Sisterhood of the Bene Gesserit, a community of women who have honed their mental powers to the point of a near magical ability to coerce, tied with a training in politics and influence that would make Machiavelli proud. Finally is the Guild: a community of mutated humans, the sole ""pilots"" able to bend space and foresee their path amidst the void and thus keep interstellar trade and community together. Both the Siterhood and the Guild owe their great powers to the mysterious spice Melange, the only product of the planet Arrakis (known colloquially as Dune) and the society of the Empire in general also depends on it for its ""geriatric qualities"". Dune is thus the linch-pin for all Imperial power. Without the spice, travel ceases, trade stops, life ends. He who controls the spice controls the universe.Upon this stage is born Paul Atreides, the son of the Duke who is to take control of Arrakis as a fiefdom for the emperor. Paul is not merely the heir to political power though, for he is the last link in a chain of breeding that has been going on for generations, part of a plan created by the Bene Gesserit in the hopes of breeding a superhuman whom they could control. But Paul was born too early, his mother's rebellion against her orders have brought about an unforeseen occurrence. Now in the midst of political betrayal and the loss of all he has known Paul must also fight for survival amongst the most merciless tribe of humanity the universe has formed. Greater powers than any human before him has known will be thrust upon the young man, and the mantle of messiah will be his to accept or reject.Did I mention that I love this book? Well I do. I highly recommend it to any and all. I must admit that there is the occasional infelicity in some of Herbert's prose (and a too-heavy reliance on inner monologues to either state the obvious or convey information to the reader), but overall I can forgive him this for having crafted such an excellent tale. Woven into the story of a tottering space empire are real questions about ecology, responsibility and human life that are well-worth thinking about. Politics is not just a veneer, but the lifeblood of this story and, to me at least, it makes it all the more exciting.I'll admit right here that I am one of the few who actually likes all of the original Dune books, though I must admit that after the original trilogy Herbert seems to lose some of the strands of his narrative thread and my admiration is mostly due to the character of (view spoiler)[ Duncan Idaho  (hide spoiler)] and the world-building. (But please avoid the prequels and sequels written by Herbert's son and Kevin Anderson in an attempt to cash in on the franchise, they are worse than anathema.)Also posted at Shelf Inflicted...more"

Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place.âThus begins one of the greatest novels ever written.About ten years ago, when I was ten or eleven years old, I took my first cautious steps away from childrenâs and young adult books and into the wonderful world of adult literature. I remember that there were especially two grand works of fiction that shaped this period of my life, and eventually managed to change it forever. The first was a huge brick of a fantasy novel whose name was The Lord of the Rings. The second was a rather small, blue book with a particularly interesting cover, which I discovered in one of my fatherâs bookshelves. Its name was Dune.And that was how I first came along on the adventures of Paul-MuadâDib on the endless sands of Arrakis. I met people like the warmaster Gurney Halleck and the swordmaster Duncan Idaho, the aging assassin Thufir Hawat, the wise and powerful Lady Jessica of the Bene Gesserit, the disgustingly evil Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, and the stunningly beautiful Princess Irulan. I encountered the greatest of the sandworms in the deep desert, and I witnessed MuadâDib as he lived amongst the mysterious blue-eyed Fremen and as he struggled and fought against those who betrayed his family.Now, ten years later, I have read the book once more. And to my great satisfaction I discovered that it had lost none of the magic that worked so well on me the first time. The political machinations of the Great Houses and the Imperium were still as interesting and exciting as the first time. The sandworms were still as awe-inspiring as when I last read about them. And even though the book could not possibly have the same effect on me today as it had on that little boy ten years ago, it was still an amazingly enjoyable book from the first page until the very end. There was more than a fair bit of nostalgia involved when it came to settling on a final rating, and I find it likely that the rating would have been lower if I were reading this for the first time. Still, I would argue that Dune is not only one of my personal favourites, but one of the absolute best examples of fictional literature ever. It has become a pillar on which dozens of later works now stand, from Star Wars to the Wheel of Time. What is it that makes this book so great? My answer would be neither the story nor the characters, even though both of those are great. No, the most extraordinary aspect about this book is most certainly its setting. In contrast to a great majority of science fiction, this novel takes place almost exclusively on one single planet. Arrakis. Dune. Desert planet. This is the world that inspired Tatooine. This is the world on which House Atreides fights for its survival in the heart of a treacherous universe. And, last but not least, this is the world where the sandworms roam.

As inclined as I am towards local coffeeshops, perhaps Herbert's head space while writing the novel in Santa Rosa, California from 1959-1965 appealed to me most. I could almost smell the incense burning.The galactic intrigue begins in the year 10,191 with excerpts from writings by the Princess Irulan, daughter of the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV and a holder of literary pretensions. The princess offers some perspective at the beginning of each chapter, hipping the reader to what's happening behind the scenes. We're introduced to Paul Atreides, the 15-year-old heir of Duke Leto Atredies, a charismatic planetary governor of Caladan whose popularity among the noble houses of the universe has garnered the attention, and jealously, of the emperor. Setting a trap, he offers Leto the planet of Arrakis, the most valuable real estate in the universe.Arrakis is inhospitable to all but titanic-sized sandworms and a fierce tribe of desert dwellers known as the Fremen, but produces the priceless spice melange. In a future where mankind no longer relies on computers, the spice is a transformative agent that expands consciousness: empowering the navigators of the Spacing Guild who travel through space, the savvy Mentats who advise heads of state and the bewitching Reverend Mothers of the Bene Gesserit sect who see the future. Leaving their ancestral home on the verdant Caladan for Arrakis with Paul is his mother, the Lady Jessica, the duke's concubine and a Bene Gesserit, who is a black sheep among the Reverend Mothers.Thus spoke St. Alia-of-the-Knife: ""The Reverend Mother must combine the seductive wiles of a courtesan with the untouchable majesty of a virgin goddess, holding these attributes in tension so long as the powers of her youth endure. For when youth and beauty have gone, she will find that the place-between, once occupied by tension, has become a wellspring of cunning and resourcefulness."" -- FROM ""MUAD'DIB, FAMILY COMMENTARIES"" BY THE PRINCESS IRULANOn moving day, Paul is visited by the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, Jessica's teacher, for a rite of passage and a test. The old crone confronts Jessica, who defied the Bene Gesserit order that she bear a daughter the sect intended to marry off to Feyd-Rautha, heir to the House Harkonnen, the industrious enemies of House Atredies. The Bene Gesserit believed the progeny of such a pairing would have produced the Kwisatz Haderach, a male with the power to see through space and time as they do. Jessica opted to bear Duke Leto the boy he wanted instead. The Reverend Mother sees some potential in Paul, but offers no hope his father will live to an old age. Paul's education is overseen by his father's advisors--Thufir Hawat (a Mentat), the troubadour-warrior Gurney Halleck, the swordmaster Duncan Idaho and Dr. Wellington Yueh--but mostly by the Lady Jessica, who has trained her son in Bene Gesserit meditative techniques. Arriving in the garrison town of Arrakeen, Jessica encounters a housekeeper named the Shadout Mapes who is full of Fremen superstitions, intrigued as to whether Jessica may be the One, mother to the messiah who their prophecy holds will lead their people out of slavery. After Paul saves the housekeeper's life from a Harkonnen booby trap intended for him, she confides to the boy that there is a traitor among them.Duke Leto forges an alliance with the Fremen, using imperial planetolgist Liet Kynes--who's gone native on Arrakis--as a liaison. Operating with the blessing of the Emperor and the assistance of his Sardaukur troops, the gluttonous Baron Vladimir Harkonnen and his Mentat, Piter De Vries, attack Arrakeen after the traitor in the House Atredies lowers the garrison's shields for them. The Baron exiles the Lady Jessica and Paul so he can claim plausible deniability in their deaths, but mother and son find refuge with the Fremen, with the tribe's revered leader Stilgar and Kynes' daughter, Chani. Paul learns of the prophecy of Muad'Dib, the desert mouse, who the Fremen hold as their messiah. Muad'Dib could indeed see the Future, but you must understand the limits of his power. Think of sight. You have eyes, yet cannot see without light. If you are on the floor of a valley, you cannot see beyond your valley. Just so, Muad'Dib could not always choose to look across the mysterious terrain. He tells us that a single obscure decision of prophecy, perhaps the choice of one word over another, could change the entire aspect of the future. He tells us ""The vision of time is broad, but when you pass through it, time becomes a narrow door."" And always, he fought the temptation to choose a clear, safe course, warning ""That path leads ever down into stagnation."" -- FROM ""ARRAKIS AWAKENING"" BY THE PRINCESS IRULANDune held me for over 616 of the paperback's 794 pages (appendixes, a map and an afterword by Brian Hebert stretch this edition to 883 pages) and in spite of its headlong dive into anticlimax, distilling the novel's pleasures have reminded me of what a fantastic trip it is. What separates Dune from the work of most of Herbert's peers is the finesse of its prose and the depth of its characters as well as its ideas, which in a novel of this size, are plenty. Rather than write a novel in six sleepless nights as many before and since have done in this genre, Herbert took six years to research and write his science fiction, and the quality control shows.Names like ""Beast"" Rabban or Count Hasimir Fenrig materialized to form clear images of Herbert's characters in my mind, and I liked how each of them--whether noble, assassin or servant--served their institutions and played their part in this galactic intrigue to their end. No one in Dune remains static; there is work to be done or movement to be had at all times. The novel is like a chess game and the faster it plunged toward its climax, these characters did begin to resemble game tokens instead of humans. Herbert also writes entrances much better than he does exits--a symptom of book one in a series, perhaps--but envisions a wealth of roles for women in his universe.Dune is science fiction and if you're in the market for having your imagination stretched, you came to the right place. I found Herbert's ideas to be vastly compelling, many of them explored in detail and at length with fluid prose, as if the author were an anthropologist reporting back on a real universe: A future where expanded consciousness is more powerful than any machine. A matriarchal religious sect steering the genetic future of mankind. A consciousness expanding spice exploited as a commodity. A planet so arid that special suits are required to retain the body's moisture and tears are a phenomenon. There's even song verse! ""This was a song of a friend of mine,"" Paul said. ""I expect he's dead now, Gurney is. He called it his evensong.""The troop grew still, listening as Paul's voice lifted in a sweet boy tenor with the baliset tinkling and strumming beneath it:""This clear time of seeing embers--A gold-bright sun's lost in first dusk.What frenzied senses, desp'rate muskAre consort of rememb'ring.""Jessica felt the verbal music in her breast--pagan and charged with sounds that made her suddenly and intensely aware of herself, feeling her own body and its needs. She listened with a tense stillness.âNightâs pearl-censered requi-em â¦âTis for us!What joys run, thenâBright in your eyesâWhat flower-spangled amoresPull at our hearts â¦What flower-spangled amoresFill our desires.âAnd Jessica heard the after-stillness that hummed in the air with the last note. Why does my son sing a love song to that girl-child? she asked herself. She felt an abrupt fear. She could sense life flowing around her and she had no grasp of its reins. Why did he choose that song? she wondered. The instincts are true sometimes. Why did he do this?After several abandoned attempts to adapt Dune to film, particularly in the wake of Star Wars, a big screen version produced by Raffaella De Laurentiis and written and directed by David Lynch opened in December 1984. Notable today for being the first big budget motion picture produced by a woman (with a production price tag of $40 million) and a rare studio assignment from the visionary who'd give the world Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks, the film was a commercial disappointment and was nearly universally panned by critics, but has resurfaced as a cult movie. Shot in Mexico, the eclectic cast featured Kyle MacLachlan as Paul, Francesca Annis as Jessica, JÃ¼rgen Prochnow as Duke Leto, Freddie Jones as Thufir Hawat, Patrick Stewart as Gurney Halleck, Richard Jordan as Duncan Idaho, Dean Stockwell as Yueh, Kenneth McMillan as Baron Harkonnen, Brad Dourif as Piter De Vries, Sting as Feyd-Rautha, Linda Hunt as Shadout Mapes, Max Von Sydow as Dr. Kynes, Everett McGill as Stilgar, Sean Young as Chani and Virginia Madsen as Princess Irulan. Herbert's ideas are evocatively translated, but Lynch's commitment to imagery over story is an acquired taste....more"

It was definitely time for me to finally read this truly great classic of science fiction!I must say that I've watched the two mini-series, Dune and Children of Dune, in my teenage years. Thus, I already had a grasp of the story, what it was about.However, nothing could have prepared me for the great writing style, the dense philosophy, ecology, and mythology of this story. It takes the term ""world-building"" to a whole new level.So what is this about?Well, that is not easily answered, but put very simply it is a book about a galactic empire and intrigue among the aristocratic houses within it. At the heart of the tale are the Emperor, the House Atreidis, and the House Harkonnen.An assassination sets into motion a very old prophecy and the uprising of a people that has been suppressed for generations.It's also about a planet that is merely a ""factory"" for melange (spice) and about the delicate balance of nature even in the most desolate of places.Now, considering where I live and current events here, I must admit that reading all the Muslim names and terms, but especially reading about Jihad, made me EXTREMELY uncomfortable. The Fremen, the natives of the planet Arrakis (the afore-mentioned ""factory"" for spice), are fanatically religious and (almost happily) willing to commit genocide. This should have really turned me off. However, the story has enough ""westerness"" on one hand (the way the aristocracy as well as certain story elements are portrayed) and Paul on the other to make up for it (Paul, despite being the prophesied saviour, does everything he can to prevent genocide and actually tries to reign in the people worshipping him). I liked the burden Paul carries and that he realizes it really is a burden (death) and was therefore torn between using his powers and knowing their limits, being chivalrous and ruthless at the same time.One of the greatest joys while reading this book (apart from the art of my edition which I shared with all of you through my status updates) was the ecology of the story. It was made clear in the introduction already, but even without that comment it would have been more than clear that Frank Herbert had the utmost respect for scientists and their work. One of the most impressive characters (Kynes) was a planetologist after all. It helps tremendously to bring this planet to life and make the reader trod from dune to cavern to city to any other place in this story. One feels the heat, the sand, the dryness of the place, and marvels just as much as any person within the story whenever there is a tiny bit of green presented or when a worm attacks.But I also enjoy the Bene Gesserit. Their plans are certainly ... ambiguous at best. Genetic perfection. But also the plan to combine all houses and therefore create a certain equilibrium (and exert control). It's cold logic and I'm strongly opposed to forced matches or ""breeding"" of humans in general, but one cannot help but wonder if events hadn't been more peaceful if everyone had played his/her part as planned.There is also a lot of heartbreak - both on the small and large scale. For example, I cannot stop thinking about the slave trade and how some people are treated by basically everyone here. Or like Irulan. In the book, Irulan has such a little active role, appearing just briefly at the very end of the tale but shining in that moment through her brave selflessnesss. Other than that, we only have quotes from various writings of hers about Muad'Dib and yet I felt so much pity for her. Sure, she lives the life of a princess with all its comforts (as opposed to the slaves or poor people of Arrakis) but although Paul is never cruel, he also doesn't love her (Irulan is just his key to the throne) and a loveless life is cruel enough in and of itself.Then again, there is Chani, having Paul's love but never going to have the chance to call herself his wife (another form of sacrifice, to say nothing of (view spoiler)[their first-born son they've lost (hide spoiler)]).Every detail in this epic story has its place and though the novel is more about a wide sweep of events instead of deep characterization, every person is unique and delightful in their own way (be it vile Baron Harkonnen - no, I don't have a problem with the main villain being gay - , weird little badass Alia, powerful but also kind of lost Paul, underestimated Fenring and his wife, or any one of the ""background characters"") and there is development (mostly for Paul of course).I cannot rave enough about this book, will watch the David Lynch movie tomorrow (since I haven't seen it yet), re-watch the mini-series for comparison and old times' sake, and (at some point in time) definitely re-read the book....more"

Where I go against what almost everyone else says about a book.Before we start, please do not be fooled by the three star rating. Even if I didn't like really like the book, I have to acknowledge there are reasons why Dune is a cornerstone of the Sci Fi genre. Now, let's talk about the important stuff.This is a masterpiece of world building.We get a new planet, and while it's obvious that Herbert based his desert planet on real sights and cultures, it's still awesome. The Fremen and their culture, the stillsuits, the worms, the plight for water... It's all explained in such a vivid detail without being boring or repetitive. And while reading you can see the references! Can we talk about how many movies and books have been influenced by this?We also get a future Empire where machines are no longer used for computation purposes. Instead, humans have been trained to unlock their full brain potential and make such calculations. And we get two schools of these ""enhanced"" humans: the Bene Gesserit and the Mentats. And we get lots of details explaining this new society: the Empire, the Noble Houses, the Guild, how each group interacts with the others, the intrigue surrounding all dealings... The plot is straightforward and follows a 'Chosen One' pattern. Paul, is the 'Chosen One', the Lisan al-Gaib, the Kwisatz Haderach. He gets many names. After a betrayal, he finds refuge among the Fremen and seeks revenge from those who wronged his house. Here comes my first problem with the book, you can divide it in a before and after around the betrayal point. (I'm not spoiling anything by telling you this, believe me, the book will tell you ALL about it) Before this the plot drags along at a slow and unpleasant pace (at least for me.) The story is told in a third person omniscient point of view, and the author uses this liberally, giving us a peek into the different characters' thoughts. And he loves repeating ideas. So we get to know about the betrayal from the bad guy who planned it, from the traitor himself, from everyone inside House Atreides who knows that there's a traitor and suspects everyone,... and all this before anything actually happens! When the scene finally rolls in I was so tired of the plot I almost gave up on the book.After this the plot actually picks up and there's lots of action. However I had some more problems with it, as I'll explain ahead.While they were all artfully created and developed; there's no way to connect with any of these characters.The way Herbert planned his 'Chosen One' and his society, most of the characters are deeply logical and, dare I say, stuffy? They think and re-think, and plan and plot, and think again, computing everything with a very small dose of humanity. (Ha! And they call themselves humans.) Paul is wise beyond his years, not only by his training, but by his evolution during the story. It made me think of another chosen child: Harry Potter, but where we all wanted to be Harry, or at least one of his friends; I really had no thought of befriending this one. (I did pity him a lot.)And then there's the bad guy! Oh Gods. I've never in my life seen such a TERRIBLE antagonist and I don't say this lightly. He's a fat ugly guy, who cannot even move himself. He's a pedophile, a slave worker, treats everyone horribly including his own family. There is absolutely no redeeming quality to this guy. He's almost cartoonish in how bad he is. And I never ever got his hate for the Atreides, I can understand greed, personal vendettas, house wars. But his hate seemed too personal and at the same time too huge to be understandable. Also, he was the typical movie villain that loved to rehash his plots over and over again, and brag about how cunning he was. Complete freaking waste of time.Last, but not least. The ending is incredibly abrupt and I DID NOT like it. Call me romantic, call me naive, call me soft. I don't care. I thought that last paragraph was the wrong thing to say. All in all this was a great book, but it wasn't my cup of tea. I suggest you read it. If only so you can see Star Wars in a pretty different light. ---Image Credits'The Defeat of the Sarduakar' by John Schoenherr.""Fremen of Dune"" by Sammy Hall ""Vladimir Harkonnen"" by a-hour...more"

You may not agree, and one book can not please everybody but statistically Dune comes closest to achieving just this. Witness how often you see it at or near the top of all-time best sf books lists.I never read Dune with the intent to reviewing it before, it makes for a more attentive and actually more enjoyable reading experience. When I first read it in my early teens I did not really appreciate it, I thought it was good but overrated. There are just too much depth for my young mind to handle. I got the gist of the story just fine but the richness of the novel completely escaped me.What makes Dune superior to most sf books is the quality of the world building. Frank Herbert went into painstaking details of Arrakis without ever bogging down the story. During the main body of the novel (excluding the appendices) he did not once resort to making info dumps. How many modern day sf authors can do that? Still, world building alone can not possibly account for the legendary status of the book. Herbert places equal emphasis on the characterization, plot and prose. The book is full of memorable characters from the badass Lady Jessica, to Paul Atreides who starts off as a fairly generic Luke Skywalkerish âchosen oneâ kid to a messianic figure always ready with a sage comment for every occasion. The villains are even more colorful, especially the super-sized Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, so fat he needs anti gravity devices to help support his girth (cue worthless yo papa so fat he needs suspensors jokes). And his psychotic nephew Feyd-Rautha who is a ruthless natural born killer and seems kind of gay for some reason. When I read it as a young lad the book seemed very long, but by todayâs gigantic epic sf/f books standard Duneâs 896 pages length does not seems like much of a challenge if you take into account almost 100 pages of appendices and glossary. It is a highly readable and accessible book that transports the reader to a very vividly realized place. If you are looking for a bit of escapism you can not beat reading Dune for the first time.That's enough review I think, I just want to make a few random observations for people who are familiar with this book (more than half the people who read this review imagine):- Most memorable scene for me is the âGom Jabbarâ test where Paul Atreides has his humanity tested by the Reverend Mother. What is yours?- I love the little quotes from all those Muad'Dib books by the Princess Irulan. How many are there? Is there a âMuad'Dibâs Cookery Without Waterâ or perhaps a Muad'Dib popup book for the kids?- The stillsuits are great, I want one!- What is with all the âah-h-hâ business most (lesser) writers make do with an ""ah!"" or an ""aha!"". Are the characters having orgasms?- Donât skip the appendices, they are well worth reading.- Last but not least, do check out Dune - Book Summary & Analysis by Thug Notes on Youtube, preferably after you have finished Dune; it's funny, insightful and informative.

Words cannot even do justice to what an epic tale this is. We learn about spirituality, human nature, politics, religion, and the making of a hero.I loved the spiritual aspects of the book the best. The philosophies and practices and Pranu Bindu training of the Bene Gesserit that Paul learns and builds upon. The Bene Gesserit believe in a training regiment that results in a superior human being - one with every sense as refined as possible. This means a focus on learning, on controlling emotion, on controlling your body. My absolute favorite quote from Dune is the Bene Gesserit litany against fear:""I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.""The litany is meant to be recited when you are in a moment of fear, and as I first read Dune 20 years ago, I've employed it many times. After Paul employs it when he is fighting Jamis, the affect on him is described as ""a cool bath washing over him. He felt muscles untie themselves, become poised and ready."" I have read a lot about people who perform at high levels - whether it be in athletics or business, and success is all about getting into that zen state where you have a clear, focused mind. Fear is the biggest thing that can cloud one's mind - usually fear of failure, but there are other forms too. While this Litany won't always eliminate it, I've felt it to be useful to recognize the fear and call it out for what it is.There is also a focus in the book on being able to read people by paying attention to the minutia. In many crucial scenes we see Paul and Jessica and others employing this skill, using not only their eyes, but reading the tone of what a person says, what their body language or actions say, and more. Imagine the poker player I could be if I learned these skills!""If you rely only on your eyes, your other senses weaken.""It's interesting to me that so many science fiction novels contemplate a future with AI (aka post-singularity). In Dune, the Butlerian Jihad was the human rebellion to rid itself of AI or ""thinking machines"". They are now banned, and in their place we have Mentats, who are humans with processing powers far greater than any thinking machine. It's unclear to the software engineer in me how exactly that could be without some sort of physical manipulation (insertion of massive amounts of transistors, for instance), but the affect is pretty cool, we get Spock-esque beings who analyze everything extremely logically, and are great at political planning ""feints within feints within feints"". There was a lot in the book about leadership. It started with Paul first learning about it from his Father, and also from the Bene Gesserit. This quote stood out to me:""She asked me to tell her what it is to rule,"" Paul said. âAnd I said that one commands. And she said I had some unlearning to do."" She hit a mark there right enough, Hawat thought. He nodded for Paul to continue. ""She said a ruler must learn to persuade and not to compel. She said he must lay the best coffee hearth to attract the finest men.""Later as he grows into a leader himself, Paul learns that the most essential ingredient to be a leader is to lead people to a worthy goal.""It was another of the essential ingredients that she felt her son needed: people with a goal. Such people would be easy to imbue with fervor and fanaticism. They could be wielded like a sword to win back Paulâs place for him.""Much has been made in modern reviews of Dune of the fact that it's clearly a statement about oil and the Middle East. The book even admits the Fremen are of Sunni descent, and many words they use (Jinn, Jihad, etc) are Arabic. I'm not sure I understand all the undertones, but one thing that was clear was about control of the worlds most precious commodity: ""The people who can destroy a thing, they control it."" I hope we are closing in on the end of the days when oil controls so much, but we aren't there yet. In the meantime, we had best beware of any future Harkonnen's....more"

The film wasn't very good. Beautiful, yes; good, not so much.I first read this novel in 1975. It seems impossible that it was over 40 years ago, but the math is inescapable and time inexorable. My teenaged brain was rewired by the read. I had a standard by which to judge all future SFnal reads, and it was a high one. I was transported into a future I was utterly convinced would be the the one I'd have descendants to live in. I suppose that could yet happen. I'm a lot less convinced now that the human race's future is that long. Age might bring wisdom, I wouldn't know about that, but it sure brought me a booster shot of cynicism.The Orange Catholic Bible, the books of the Empress Irulan, they all seemed to me so real...the cry ""never to forgive, never to forget"" rings louder today than it did in 1975 because I've lived through so many iterations of it by now. Us people, we love the shit out of our vicious vengeful vendettas, don't we. Frank Herbert got that right as all hell.Trouble is, ol' Frank wasn't any kind of a writer, was he? He had flashes of good phrasemaking, he had long stretches of competent prosemongering, and then there was the rest of the ninety jillion words in the novel. Serviceable is le mot juste. And TBH I feel pretty generous putting it that way.But then came David Lynch. Oh dear, oh dear. I'm not a worshipper of Lynch's at the best of times. I thought Blue Velvet was brummagem and boring; Twin Peaks was portentous twaddle. So the Kool-Aid passed my seat, I fear. His 1984 adaptation of Dune was downright laughable. I left the theater torn between gales of laughter and gusts of grief-stricken tears. Sting in that stupid winged underwear! KYLE MacLACHLAN as Paul Atreides!! Ludicrous, all of it, and the problems started with the butchery of so much of the novel that even the bones were scattered in no sensible pattern. Inevitable, really, as the runtime of the film was a paltry two hours and seventeen minutes. Imagine trying to wedge a 600-page magnum opus dense with world-building and replete with internal ironies and levels of meaning into the length of a good winter's nap. Didn't work so good.SciFi Channel, gods please bless their collective hides, approved a mini-series written and directed by John Harrison in 2000. It was 4:17:07 in total. That was *almost* enough to do justice to the story. The result was infinitely superior to the Lynch version. It was a joy to watch for me, a forty-year-old cruelly wounded mess of a man, and felt like a balm to my fanboy memory of the novel. Perfect? No. Great? Yep!Then I found it on YouTube and thought I'd take a respite from reality by giving it a rewatch. You know what? Special effects age badly. Mid-budget TV ones age really, really, really badly. The screenplay clunked a good deal. The story, however, was all there and was well done, with the prunings and bonsai sculptings well chosen and well shaped. And the story was just about as timely as anything I could've hoped to avoid!Dune bashed me upside the temples with its portrayal of the collapse of Empire and revolution of the have-nots in a way it couldn't have 17 or 42 years ago. It felt more timely, it packed more wallop than it possibly could have in fatter times. This is my idea of good myth-making: A story that isn't finished telling us the truth yet, and doing so in a way that compels, impels, propels us to go on the journey ready or not. The idea of a Savior come to rescue us is eternally appealing, the sight of the unworthy getting their comeuppance is evergreen. It wasn't what I was seeking, wasn't escapist boom-bang-blowwie, but it was what I needed. A bit of heartening to fight again, odds be buggered.And now I'm told that there's a new version on the way, possibly to be directed by Denis Villeneuve of Arrival fame. That's some fire-power there. A director with clout and access to Hollywood's cash box could do something special with this epic...though I'm still very concerned with the issues inevitable in adapting the story to movie length. Isn't it interesting how every decade seems to call for a new version of the story? The 1960s had the novel; the 1970s the unmade Alejandro Jodorowsky adaptation, a perfect reflection of the decade's malaise/limitation mentality; the 1980s cheesy, overblown one-note-and-it's-the-wrong-one ethos; the 1990s void, again perfectly in keeping with the culture; the 2000s TV version, as everything shrunk in the aftermath of the floodwaters of Bush's election stealing; and now a big-budget, major-talent remake! That hasn't happened yet! And bids fair not to, in the parlous economic times ahead!Frank Herbert's Dune is a great rewatch. The novel hasn't finished with us yet.

All authors create little worlds in their stories but Herbert created a world.He doesn't just say that Arrakis is a desert planet, he engrosses himself and the reader into the geology.He puts people on the planet, governments, conflicting cultures, conflicting religions, conflicting ways of life that are thought out to the Nth level above and beyond anything else I've ever read. You could write a sociology or politics dissertation on the societal relations Herbert conceived for Dune.Now is complexity itself a thing to be admired in a work of fiction? Generally no, but Dune is so immense and so detailed that it creates and inhabits a category of its own. The very fact that it often reads more like a National Geographic article than a sci-fi novel speaks to its peculiar charm.Admittedly, this will not appeal to everyone. In fact, odds are that it will appeal to hardly anyone. But limited appeal should in no way factor into a work's quality. Compare the Academy Award-winning films against the yearly box office numbers if you don't agree. I'm sure Armaggeddon outgrossed Monster's Ball.And amidst all this complexity lies a kind of new myth that blends mysticism, religion, and crass real-world politics. It's a hybrid; it's not The Odyssey and it's certainly not Star Wars but I do find great appeal in its particular take on Campbell's hero's journey. And the fact that it plumbs the intricacies of Muslim/Arab/desert culture adds another layer of exotic flair to the work.As if all that wasn't ambitious enough, it even articulates a fascinatingly dark but pragmatic destiny for humanity as a whole.And all of these incredibly ambitious elements are all tightly woven together. Take out one element and the story loses its cohesion. Despite all the ridiculous amounts of detail there is nothing extraneous in this novel.Dune is a remarkable, magnificent accomplishment. But it's okay if it's not to your taste....more

I never went on to the rest of the cycle though and perhaps sometime I will go back and reread this and then continue deeper into Frank Herbert's world. I remember that I was impressed with the details and the ideas in this fantastical science fiction and - although I loved the movie with its at-the-time state of the art special effects - I know it was not very faithful to the book or its characters. To re-read.

Anyway, Duke Leto Atreides accepts control of a desert planet called Arrakis (aka Dune) which also happened to be the only source of some substance called spice which importance is slowly revealed in the course of the book. By the way the reasons for this duty and its acceptance are at best murky to begin with and they are never explained and become even more unclear down the road.Dune used to be a stronghold and the major source of wealth of Duke's sworn enemy Baron Vladimir Harkonnen who actually somehow managed to arrange the whole thing to finally deal a mortal blow to the Duke.And so the story begins. I just barely scratch the surface of it as it deals with a lot of intrigues, politics, religion issues, secret societies, survival on the planet which never saw a single drop of rain and where the wealth is counted in the amount of water owned. The most importantly, this is a story about the danger of creating a hero prophet.The book was originally published in 1965 and it does show its age, especially in the light of countless other books it inspired with the quality of the latter ranging from really pale imitations to great pieces of literature in their own way. I would not even call it a work of science fiction in the modern definition of the world. A relatively new term ""sword and planet"" would be a better genre description for it.I already mentioned the inspirations and imitations of the book. The reason for them is a very detailed world which looks completely unlike ours, yet is so similar to it. More importantly, it feels alive with its own landscapes, culture, religion, people, their rivalries and friendships. The worldbuilding is top-notch easily holding its own against undisputed king of that in fantasy, Middle Earth.The characters and their development are different story though. The only character who feels completely 3-dimensional with a good development is Paul Atreides, the Duke's son. I can somewhat agree that Jessica almost - but not completely - qualifies. The rest of the characters feel like cardboard cutouts, even the most important ones like Stilgar. As to the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen: he looks like an absolutely static caricature with practically all imaginable bad human indulgences thrown into to make him look completely repulsive.The strengths of the book easily overweight the weakness I mentioned before; the latter can be easily overlooked. The book became a victim to its own hype: it does not deserve the title of the most important and the best science fiction work ever which it is often credited with. Due to all the hype I am a little disappointed - enough to lower its rating by half a star. This review is a copy/paste of my BookLikes one: http://gene.booklikes.com/post/897366......more"

That would have been a pity as Dune is so much more than a story about space travel and epic battles between good and evil. It presents complex philosophical ideas, explores ecological issues, cultural identity and differences. Also a major theme is represented by religion and religious leadership. The disturbing part about this book, taken in the current political context, (I am not sure if Herbert did it on purpose or not) is how easily the Fremen can be identified with an Arab nation. The spice can be seen as âoilâ and the Harkonnens as evil westerners/Russians that are exploiting the natural resources without thinking about the locals and the environment. I saw that others reviewers saw this as well. ...more

This massive epic of political intrigue, messianic heroes, vile villains, invincible desert fighters, telepathic witches, sandworms and spice, guild pilots who fold space, and a relentless action-packed narrative that still has ample room for beautiful descriptive passages and copious philosophizing on the mythology of the messiah/savior. In short, Dune is a perfect SF novel that both entertains and engages the mind, a book frequently cited as the greatest single work of imagination produced in the genre, rivaled only by J.R.R. Tolkienâs The Lord of the Rings.And yet the book had a troubled birth, being rejected by over twenty publishers before being accepted by Chilton Books, better known for publishing repair manuals. How could a book later considered a masterpiece be so roundly rejected? The answer lies in the status and expectations of the genre in the 1960s. At the time, SF was still mainly known for its most famous practitioners, Robert Heinlein, Arthur C. Clarke, and Isaac Asimov, who represented an older Golden Age of SF, focused mainly on science, technology, and space adventure.Dune was a completely new creature, so far ahead of its time with itâs emphasis on a baroque far-future universe dominated by competing Great Houses bound to an Emperor, a guild of space pilots, the matriarchal Bene Gesserit witches, geneticall-modified humans called Mentats that served as computing devices, and the complexities of a galactic economy dependent for commerce on a substance known as the âspiceâ mÃ©lange that extends health and lifespan, expands consciousness, and most importantly allows the guild pilots to fold space and connect the disparate planets of the Empire. In addition, Frank Herbert was very interested in Middle Eastern cultures and Eastern religions like Zen Buddhism, as well as in desert ecologies and the preciousness of water. Weaving this massive and complex group of themes into a coherent, exciting, and moving narrative following the fate of messiah Paul Atreides, later known MuadâDib, was a feat that few authors have ever achieved since then, including Frank Herbert himself. In fact, Dune spawned five sequels directly written by Frank Herbert, and then over 10 books that fill in the numerous details of his universe, written by his son Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, who seems to specialize in co-authoring various series such as Star Wars, X-files, and all kinds of novelizations. Most recently his book The Dark Between the Stars was a 2014 Hugo Award nominee. I'm not really interested in reading these spin-off books, when there are so many other books to be read. I did read the five sequels written by Herbert back in high school, and it was a punishing experience, as the first two books (Dune Messiah and Children of Dune) deliberately debunked the messiah mythology established in Dune, showing how the Fremen used Paul Atreidesâ status as messiah to wage a destructive jihad across the universe. Itâs interesting to hear comments that Herbert intended all along to show what happens when the masses believe in a messiah, and how they participate in the process of creating one. His view is actually quite skeptical, but since Dune is about the rise of the messiah, it benefited from the positive early stage of Paulâs story arc. However, his follow-ups quickly drained my enthusiasm. I guess it should come as no surprise that we prefer to be swept along with the rise of a messianic superbeing, rather than observe the messy aftermath after his rise to power, and various political and religious divisions complicate the world after he takes over. Herbert wanted to explore these themes in great detail, but they were certainly much less commercially-appealing that Dune. I found the next three books (God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune, Chapterhouse Dune) more interesting but also very complicated and hard to enjoy. Herbert wrote quite a number of other SF novels outside the Dune universe, but he will always be known best for Dune to the exclusion of his other works, and this must have weighed heavily on him as a writer.The story itself focuses on two feuding families, the House Atreides and House Harkonnen. The latter has been in charge of administering the production of Spice on Arrakis, but as House Atreides has gained in power, the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV decided to place the Atreides in charge of Arrakis, with the intention of drawing them into conflict with the Harkonnes and keeping both in check. House Atreides is led by Duke Leto Atreides, his concubine the Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica, and Letoâs son Paul, who is part of a secret breeding program to create a Kwisatz Haderach, a male messiah with incredible mental powers who will lead the Bene Gesserit and humanity to greater heights.The levels of intrigue and complexity are staggering, and though a description cannot do it proper justice, Herbertâs complete dedication to his creation recalls the massive world-building achieved by Tolkien in Middle Earth. Despite all the alien concepts, politics, intrigues, warring groups, desert warriors, and mish-mash of Zen Buddism, Islamic and Christian mythology about messiahs and jihads, and the complex economic and ecological implications of the sandworms and spice, the reader is completely drawn into this world and believes in it. It is truly an amazing achievement, recalling how fans embraced George Lucasâ Star Wars universe, but so much more complex, dark, and mature in its themes. As this was the first time I revisited Dune since high school, I decided to get the ensemble-cast audiobook version. Itâs complete with sounds effects like the sound of desert winds blowing and ominous music, and these are carefully done not to detract from the narration. A note on the narration, however: the books starts out with a full cast of voice actors, but then switches to a single narrator (Simon Vance?) midway and towards the end, with a few scattered scenes with the full cast. Itâs a bit disorienting, especially as the voice of Baron Harkonnen switches from a simpering evil character to a deep-voiced and powerful voice akin to Michael Clarke Duncan. It would have been better to kept the full cast for the entire book, but for some reason it got a bit jumbled. Still, itâs an excellent audiobook production.Jodorowskyâs Dune (2013 documentary; actual movie never filmed)It was inevitable that Dune captured the imaginations of film directors, but the scale and complexity of the story made the transition to film extremely difficult. Film rights were acquired in 1971 but little progress was made until 1974, when a French group acquired the rights and Alejandro Jodorowsky, a Chilean avant-garde film maker, writer/poet and spiritual figure most famous for his 1970 bizarro Western El Topo and The Holy Mountain. His ambitious plans for the film would have reached about 12-20 hours in length, and featured roles for Salvador Dali (lured by ego-stroking), Orson Wells (lured by food and drink), David Carradine, Pink Floyd, Magma, and even Mick Jagger. The artwork would involve the legendary Jean Giraud (of Moebius fame) and H.R. Giger (of Alien fame). Alas, such an ambitious and sprawling project was doomed to failure, and this story is detailed in the 2013 documentary Jodorowskyâs Dune. I watched this recently, and itâs a very revealing portrait of an avante-garde artist. His vision was so wild and hallucinogenic that he said audiences would not need to drop LSD because his film could replicate that experience. His statements about his vision are quite eye-opening:In my version of Dune, the Emperor of the galaxy is insane. He lives on an artificial gold planet, in a gold palace built according to not-laws of antilogical. He lives in symbiosis with a robot identical to him. The resemblance is so perfect that the citizens never know if they are opposite the man or the machine...In my version, the spice is a blue drug with spongy consistency filled with a vegetable-animal life endowed with consciousness, the highest level of consciousness. It does not stop taking all kinds of forms, while stirring up unceasingly. The spice continuously produces the creation of the innumerable universes.I changed the ending, evidently â¦ I did that. It was my Dune. When you make a picture, you must not respect the novel. Itâs like, you get married, no? You go with the wife, white, the woman is white, you take the woman, if you respect the woman, you will never have child. You need to open the costume and to rape the bride. And then you will have your picture. I was raping Frank Herbert, raping, like this! But with love, with love.No wonder Frank Herbert disavowed any connection with this project. And despite Jodorowskyâs clear fascination with the source material, he saw no reason not to change it completely. In fact, he hadnât even read the book when he pitched the idea, and his screenplay demonstrates a willful lack of knowledge of the actual events in the book. Itâs not clear that he ever read the book, period, and the same goes for H.R. Giger. Not a biggie when weâre talking about artists, apparently. My ambition with Dune was tremendous. So, what I wanted was to create a prophet. I want to create a prophet... to change the young minds of all the world. For me, Dune will be the coming of a god. Artistical, cinematographical god. For me, it was not to make a picture. It was something deeper. I wanted to make something sacred, free, with new perspective. Open the mind! Because I feel, in that time, myself, inside a prison. My ego, my intellect, I want to open! And I start the fight to make Dune.The documentary suggests that, although the film was never actually made, its influence on other SF film projects is huge, probably because the pitch-book made the rounds of the Hollywood studios. The film can take credit for bringing together Dan OâBannon (producer of The Dark Star) and H.R. Giger (Swiss artist who created the drawings for Ridley Scottâs Alien), for getting legendary French artist Moebius to make thousands of storyboard sketches and full-color character drawing, and also well-known SF artist Chris Foss to contribute his iconic spaceships. It ends with a series of overlays of the storyboard with actual films, frequently with astonishing similarities in costumes and images, as diverse as Flash Gordon, Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, He-Man, and Prometheus. While itâs debatable exactly how much these films were directly inspired, itâs certainly food for thought. So in the end, though it was probably not âThe Greatest Film Never Madeâ, it was an admirably insane and unwieldy project that produced a spurt of creative energy that was simply too much for Hollywoodâs commercial studios. It may have been incredible masterpiece, or a complete and utter disaster, but itâs unfortunate that we never got to see Jodorowskyâs mind-altering vision on film. David Lynchâs Dune (1984)After plans for Ridley Scott to direct fell through, it was not until 1981 that Dino De Laurentiisâ daughter approached David Lynch to bring Dune to the big screen. Wait, you mean the director of Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart, and Twin Peaks? Thatâs right. Itâs still a mystery why Lynch chose to direct Dune, since he had not shown interest in the SF genre and had not even read the book (a common theme here). But to his credit, he made a valiant effort to put on film this notoriously difficult and sprawling work.As could have been predicted, the Lynch film was severely panned by film critics, moviegoers, and fans of the novel. It was dark, confusing, and incoherent (due to excessive cutting to get it to 2 hrs 17 min in length), and the Baron Harkonnen was so physically revolting to look at that I had to turn away from some of his scenes. But it did feature a great soundtrack by Toto (especially the haunting closing credits) with the prophecy theme written by Brian Eno. And it I will never forget Kyle MacLachlan as Paul Atreides in the final climactic scene, a knife fight to the death with Feyd Rautha Harkonnen, played perfectly by Sting! Even Sean Young and Patrick Stewart have important roles as Chani and Gurney Halleck. But this was another doomed attempt. Try to imagine cramming all the plot details, background information on the political machinations of the dozens of characters and factions, details on the complex ecology of Arrakis, the relationship of the sandworms and spice, the Fremen and Bene Gesserit, into a film just over 2 hours long. The studioâs demands for cuts were so drastic that Lynch has since dissociated himself from the film and refuses to talk about it. Thatâs a shame, because many have revised their initial negative views on the film and I consider it a valiant if failed attempt at scaling the Everest of SF films.Sci Fi Channel Miniseries (2000; Directorâs Cut: 295 min)This is by far the least well-known version of Frank Herbertâs SF masterpiece. In fact, itâs not easy to get a copy as itâs not available for sale new on DVD or download. That should have set off alarm bells, but what the heck, I had to see for myself. I finally had to order a used DVD copy on Amazon. Big mistake~What can I say other than, âOh the humanity!â Iâm fully aware that a TV miniseries does not have access to the same budget resources, A-list actors, top-notch special effects, and artistic talent. But what a disaster this was. Within a few minutes I knew I was along for a long and painful ride. Every frame is amateurish, the amount of inept fight scenes and obvious blue-screen work made me suppress chuckles, but that was only topped by the hopelessly wooden acting of a cast of unknowns expect for William Hurt, who must have deliberately toned it down not to make the others feel bad. The entire production is clumsy through-and-through, and the only redeeming feature is that the costumes in the film are SO OUTLANDISH that they provide entertainment of a different sort. For example, the stillsuits of the Fremen, which looked believable in the Lynch film, have become flimsy green-camouflaged rain jackets found in the discount bin:https://mialacostumes.files.wordpress...And the Fremen themselves are just low-rate extras from a different back-lot set filming Middle-Eastern marketplace scenes. Even more gut-busting were the blatant samurai armor rip-offs that passed for Harkonnen soldiersâ armor:http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/v...If that wasnât enough, the Imperial Sardaukar storm troopers, supposedly the most lethal and feared fighters in the galaxy, had silly black headgear like this:https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/... Finally, I had to save a special place for the ridiculous outfits of the Guild Navigatorsâ representatives:http://dvdmedia.ign.com/dvd/image/dun...Itâs easy to ridicule film-making this bad, but I have to give credit for one thing. One of the fatal flaws of Lynchâs Dune was that it tried to cram an incredibly-complex SF epic into just 2 hours+ of film (unwillingly, I know). So anyone familiar with the book could lament the wholesale destruction of the plot to force the story into that timeframe. Itâs no surprise that most critics and viewers unfamiliar with the book were completely lost. Well, the mini-series does put back in dozens of story arcs to make it much more faithful to the book, and that was appreciated. Itâs easier to recognize the source material in this version, but the poor production and acting quickly torpedo this.In fact, the miniseries essentially re-shoots almost the entire Lynch film, scene by scene, in an attempt to do it âbetterâ. There are hardly any scenes left untouched, but I couldnât help thinking I preferred the actors and cinematography of the Lynch film in almost every case. I can imagine the producers pitching this project as âletâs do Dune again, and get it right this time.â Well, I second those feelings, but this was not it, not by a long shot. Judging from the recent prominence of big-budget cable TV productions like Game of Thrones, Man in the High Castle, the 300, the Expanse, and the vast improvement in special effects, it strikes me that Dune is ripe for another adaptation, and could easily fill several quality seasons in the right hands. Imagine the creative team of GOT getting behind this project â it could be amazing. Because Dune the book has yet to be done justice, so thereâs a great opportunity here for a skilled team. Any takers?...more

Well, probably not, because you saw my rating, but whatever. Anyfloop, I dug the shit out of this book, and my opening comments are why. I was utterly transported to this sandy bastard of a planet, and while it wasn't always fun, it was always an escape. Some sections go on way too long, but I only realized how little the information-to-story-progression ratio was once I finished certain chapters. Although, while I was reading them, I honestly didn't notice. In hindsight, yeah, this book is heavy, but it's a sexy kinda heavy, like Ashley Graham in Sports Illustrated. All the right worldbuilding in all the right places. (I'll wait here while you Google ""Ashley Graham Sports Illustrated"". I know I'll have to wait longer for the dudes and the ladies who dig ladies to ""come"" back, but that's all right. Have fun. Just don't get any on your chins.) I think I am one of the only people on this third rock from the sun that hasn't a) seen the movie version of this book, or b) read this mammoth-sized motherfucker of a novel. My mother loves the movie. She's seen it a hundred times, if not more, but I never could get into it. The floating, bubbling fat man always put me off. Now that I have even more to go on concerning Baron Harkonnen, I find him even more disgusting. The Baron is all about that booty. That underaged-boy booty, and me thinks his neck is deserving of a crysknife.Being that I enjoy a bit of the ol' strum strum, I think my favorite character throughout the entire book was Gurney Halleck. He's a wicked talented basilet player, yo, and one hell of a dedicated, honorable individual. I enjoyed his storyline the most, especially when I legitimately thought he was about to cut a chick. Such a harrowing scene, and such a long time coming. I'm glad it turned out the way it did, but for a minute there, I wouldn't have minded had it went the other way.Paul was probably my least favorite character, as he played the ""Chosen One"" role and I'm not a fan of that storyline. Never have dug the people who turn instant badass due to prophecy. That being said, it didn't detract from my experience. Paul, in my opinion, was simply the weakest link. And finally, every scene with a worm in it fucking rocked, but my favorite worm scene has to be the first one, where Duke Leto decides to save the spice miners. I saw that scene so clearly in my head. Man, that was fantastically written. In summation: I can see why Dune has withstood the test of time and maintained the label of one of the ""Best Science Fiction Books in Existence."" Herbert handled third-person omniscient stunningly well, and I was never confused while reading, as can be the case with some authors.

This one is going to be full of silliness.Arrakis. The desert planet. Home to spice and sandworms. Dune. You know, I went to the desert once. The Sahara Desert. It looked like this (ps I took this picture!):I don't feel like tracking down a picture from the movie, so you have to imagine what Arrakis looks like. It looks a lot like the Sahara.So anyway, one of the ""things to do"" when you're in Morocco is to drive out into the Sahara and go for a camel ride, stay overnight in a Berber tent. Ah, camels. I don't know if any of you have ridden a camel (but I'm sure if you have, you will back me up on this): not as much fun as you would think. Riding a horse is, let's face it, always a little uncomfortable. You have to straddle it (twss!), you have to keep your legs at a weird angle (twss!), it starts to hurt after a while (uh... twss?). Riding a camel, on the other hand, sucks. Camels do not wear saddles. They wear blankets. A camel's hump is not very squishy for something that is supposed to be full of water, if my elementary school understanding of why they can live in the desert is accurate. If kind of feels like you are sitting on a rock, and it feels like someone is repeatedly hitting your public bone with a baseball bat. This is not just a guy thing; my girlfriend confirmed that after about five minutes, riding a camel ceases being at all fun and becomes an exercise in pain management. It hurt like hell while it was happening, and it was hard to walk the next day (omg, twss!).On Dune, the desert-inhabiting Fremen don't ride camels. They ride these:Scary. But probably not more uncomfortable to ride than a camel.Look, this is me with Fergie. I am smiling because I am no longer riding it.Other than the sand and stuff, Arrakis is pretty different from Western Africa. Like the sandworms, which attack anyone who dares venture into the desert, there are the Fremen, a mysterious tribe of fighters who have a strange relationship with what they call ""the Markers,"" there is this stuff called spice that must be carefully harvested from the sands, the risk rewarded by the incredible worth of the spice as a drug used by the Guild to gives the navigators the prescient sight they need to chart courses through hyperspace, and by the Bene Gesserit witches, why use it to preserve their ways from generation to generation. Also I don't think Dune had package tours.Dune is a famously boring and complicated book. You may have heard that it has a lengthy appendix, and that when David Lynch turned it into a movie, the story was so complex that audiences had to be given cheat sheets along with their tickets. (Don't blame Frank Herbert for that, though. The Dune movie is just marvelously bad, as this chart will illustrate:)Don't let its reputation fool you. Sure, Dune is a little bit boring in parts (the characters like to philosophize redundantly and have prophetic visions). But it is also an awesome space opera, with an entirely transporting sense of place and vidiv world-building. The political struggles that drive the plot engine are fiendishly complex to the occasional point of obtusion (I can't believe that is a word), but also a lot of fun to read about, thanks to sneering villains like Baron Harkonnen, who isn't just any old bad guy, but a grossly obese, slithery, murdering, rapist pedophile. The Fremen, a tribe of deeply spiritual religious fanatics who control a natural resource and are willing to die for what they believe... in. Hmmmm. And then there are the sandworms. I loved everything about this concept, from Herbert's vivid descriptions, to their presence as an omnipresent threat throughout the book, to their epic inclusion in the explosion and violence-heavy climax. Awesome.I haven't really said anything about the book. It's good. It's Dune. It is a super-famous classic for a reason. It has compelling characters (Lady Jessica is one of the most interesting female protagonists in classic sci-fi, and the book's take on gender politics, with an elite group of women are a powerful, secretive and controlling force in the galaxy , is worth examining.) It is epic in scope. It's nearly as deep as Tolkien (there's that appendix).It's also just cool....more"

But I loved the elements that dealt more closely with the human drama, the personal choices characters make, their interactions with others, how they cope internally with themselves and their own strengths and weaknesses.

PregÃºntenle a LOTR. Si, porque una obra maestra se lee, y despuÃ©s se estudia. No saben lo mucho que me gusta leer una historia que se sienta como un trabajo hecho a conciencia. Dune es para aquellos lectores pacientes que de verdad buscan un ClÃ¡sico moderno de la Ciencia FicciÃ³n.  Es una lectura tan completa que algo en el picara tu curiosidad, pero si no tienes interÃ©s en polÃ­tica y ecologÃ­a, este libro se te harÃ¡ largo, largo como un gusano de arena ;)La trama general es simple. A la Casa Atreides se le ha trasferido la administraciÃ³n del planeta Arrakis, tambiÃ©n conocido como Dune. Pero que razones o maquinaciones encierra ese cambio de administraciÃ³n es una de las muchas cosas por descubrir en este libro. Y dÃ©jenme les digo que las cosas no empiezan a encajar hasta como las ultimas 100 paginas. La introducciÃ³n es enorme, el universo creado muy basto y las subtramas, que incluyen mucha filosofÃ­a sobre religiÃ³n, liderazgo, sociedad y ecologÃ­a, muy sutiles. Pero que culminan en un gran final sin necesidad de llevar tanta adrenalina como ya es muy comÃºn en libros nuevos. Los personajes son todos interesantes, muy complejos la mayorÃ­a y el dialogo y exposiciÃ³n estuvieron al punto. Me agradan los libros que no te dejan en claro por completo lo que esta sucediendo, hacen que mi cerebro funcione y piense mÃ¡s de lo normal, para variar okno. En general es un trabajo muy bien logrado a cargo de una obvia mente brillante. Si hay o no simbolismos a acciones del siglo pasado o referencias a ciertas religiones ya dependerÃ¡ de ti y de que tanta atenciÃ³n le prestes.

As far as I can tell, Dune largely inspires two points of view. One marvels at its historical importance and world-building (unique, fascinating, complex, rich), and the other dislikes the stilted writing but does so apologetically because Frank Herbert couldn't help the fact that he wrote science fiction in the 1960s and that Edward Said hadn't done his thing yet. Come  on , people of the world. Linear models of progress don't apply to good writing. Frank Herbert can't write because he's a shitty writer, not because it was the 1960s. The dialogue is clunky and characters have endless internal monologues (in italics) that serve no purpose but to explain incredibly obvious plot points to the reader. This is an embarrassingly novice mistake. The plot also lacks any element of surprise. Princess Irulan, oblivious to the concept of spoiler alerts, summarizes all major plot points in her historical vignettes which introduce every single chapter. We can't wonder about whether and how  Jesus Christ  Paul will become the messiah of the people because the princess has already told us before we've begun the book. We can't wonder about who the traitor in the Atreides house is because Princess Irulan's vignette is all like ""Yueh! Yueh! A million deaths were not enough for Yueh!"" And then there's the world-building. It is So. Fucking. Lazy. Half the words are lifted from Arabic and  Arab  Fremen culture is the result of a scavenger rampage through Islamic concepts, scraps of Buddhism, and Frank Hebert's Orientalist curiosities all cobbled together into a cringe-inducing whole. The main subject of this book, the  sand niggers  Fremen, have been in the desert for thousands of years, border on religious fanaticism, and haven't changed a bit over time. They pray salat, conserve water (because hello, desert), and wait for their white savior Paul to bring them out into the light (or into the shade, as it were). They frequently declare Muslim-sounding things in bastardized Arabic and are very upset because the Imperial forces are preventing them from doing Haj. It's unclear how the Imperial forces have blocked all outbound flights to Saudi Arabia, but we'll take it on faith. There was a jihad situation, like, hundreds of years ago but it was apparently a jihad against computers? I don't know. The  ragheads  Fremen also do this thing where two men will fight to the death and the winner will take the dead man's woman as his wife or his servant. Given the history of the U.S., I think it's hilarious that a book full of racism, imperialism, and misogyny was considered groundbreaking in the 1960s. The other thing that makes this book unreadable is Frank Herbert's I-Tarzan-You-Jane approach to gender:âThere is in each of us an ancient force that takes and an ancient force that gives. A man finds little difficulty facing that place within himself where the taking force dwells, but itâs almost impossible for him to see into the giving force without changing into something other than man. For a woman, the situation is reversed â¦ The greatest peril to the Giver is the force that takes. The greatest peril to the Taker is the force that gives."" Man has the mighty penis. Mighty penis does the thrusting action. Woman has the sacred hole. Sacred hole is warm and open for mighty penis penetration. Thanks for clearing that up, Frank. Male and female characters in this book align nicely with Frank's pole-in-hole view of the world. The men do the war because the penis. The women do the manipulation and mind control because the vagina. They are either wives or concubines, and having children is of utmost important. Man and his woman sometimes have tender conversations about all of this. Observe: ""[Paul] began tightening his still suit. ""You told me once the words of Kitab al-Ibar,"" he said. ""You told me: 'Woman is thy field; go then to thy field and till it.'"" ""I am the mother of thy firstborn,"" she agreed."" How romantic. Anyway, let's talk some more about Paul, our white messiah. When he's taking a break from tilling his fields, he's busy being a cartoon hero. He has no flaws. Like, none. He sees everything, understands everything, knows the future, and every word out of his mouth is prophetic and vaguely Shakespearean. This is the kind of shit he says: [Re. aforementioned penis/vagina theory]""""And you, my son,"" Jessica asked, ""are you one who gives or one who takes?"" ""I'm at the fulcrum,"" he said. ""I cannot give without taking and I cannot take without [giving].""""You're SIXTEEN, bitch. Sit down and shut the fuck up. Nobody cares. Opposite the cartoon hero is the cartoon villain. He's really, really evil. He wakes up evil, goes to bed evil, and all the time in the middle, he has evil conversations and evil thoughts. Many of his evil thoughts are in italics so we know EXACTLY where the story is headed because plot twists are also evil and will not be tolerated. Please note, he is also fat as fuck and eats a lot. Also, he's a big homo. And the homo's a pedo. I really have nothing more to say. I AM glad I took the time to wade through this shitstorm of misogyny and orientalism. You can't read sci-fi and not have read Dune. I always suspected I might hate it, but at least now I have proof. ...more"

Dune is, without doubt, a groundbreaking story with a complex and enthralling universe. The concept of Dune is exhilarating: sandworms, a messiah, the Fremen and their spice. The actual reading, however, is a slightly less perfect experience.Princess Irulan states from the beginning that precocious Paul is not only meant for greatness, he's already a Legend. So Dune is not much about Paul struggling to believe he's the One as it is about Paul in his heroic journey fighting his fate: the unstoppable Fremen jihad he so much wants to avoid. We can see him time after time refusing to be what his prescience has showed him. And on that note, there's a lot of Dune that you know from the beginning because foreshadowing is the key word. The funny thing is, Herbert keeps telling the story as if you haven't already been warned. (view spoiler)[Leto's death, Harkonen's attack, Paul as leader of the Fremen, Muad'Dib AND Kwisatz Haderach. (hide spoiler)]When you talk about Dune, you have to admit the world-building is flawless but when it comes to character development, time-skip is its biggest enemy and mine: I'm a characters reader. And even if the characters were on spot most of the time, Herbert insisted on laying out their inner thoughts instead of actual dialogs which was incredibly annoying. There is little to no characterization maybe because Herbert indulges his interest in ecology, political philosophy, religion and the messianic quest more than anything else which, if I understand correctly, is perfectly okay for the genre. I didn't get to see the actual development of the characters and so there was a lot of guessing for me: about Fremen as a society, Paul and Chani's relationship, his son, and more. Herbert chooses to leave you in the dark most of the time and when answers come, they're scarce and unsatisfying. So you keep reading! It's a page turner, alright, but because you're in painful need to make sense of the story. And you kinda love it, honestly.Despite all this, I'm completely captivated by Herbert's creative world. I couldn't get enough of Paul's ability to see present, past and future as a now, the pseudo-technology, the Bene Gesserit and of course, the spice and its properties to name a few.All in all, it was a great book and I enjoyed a lot of it even if I fought with Herbert through the whole experience. I'm not sure if I'll keep up with the series, though, but I'm sure fans of the genre will absolutely love this.Mind-blowing art by Mark Molnar ...more

The galaxy-wide governing Imperium is medieval in character, with an Emperor ruling over Great Houses. The novel takes place on the planet Arrakis, a remote location of unimaginable value to both the Emperor and the Great Houses - being the only known source in the galaxy for mÃ©lange. This is a spice which is used crucially by the Space Guild; to prolong life and protect against disease (by those able to obtain it); and (by the Bene Gesserit) to enhance their secret mental abilities.The main players in the novel EmperorThe Padishah Emperor, Shadam IV, rules the Imperium at the time of the novel. He is the 81st such ruler in his bloodline, the House Corrino. His fighting forces, the Sardaukar, are the most vicious and feared warriors in the galaxy.Spacing GuildThe Spacing Guild is a powerful commercial entity having a monopoly on both interstellar travel and banking within the Imperium. Of special note are Guild Navigators, who (through a cultivated addiction to melange) have developed the ability to guide spacecraft from one star system to another through âfolded spaceâ at instantaneous speeds.AtreidesHouse Atreides, in the person of Leto Atreides (the Red Duke), begins the novel ruling the planet Caladan. Leto is pressured by the Emperor to move his kingdom to Arrakis near the start of the novel, and take over the governance of that important planet. Leto is the father of Paul Atreides, the main character of the novel. Paulâs mother, a concubine of the Dukeâs, is Lady Jessica â a Bene Gesserit who is the main female character.HarkonnenHouse Harkonnen is a house with blood relation to House Atreides, but at the time of the novel the two houses have become sworn enemies. House Harkonnen supplies most of the villains for the story, the chief being Baron Vladimir Putin Harkonnen.Bene GesseritThe Bene Gesserit are an ancient society of women, both well-known in the Imperium but also very secret regarding their mental abilities and ultimate purposes. Often referred to in the novel as âwitchesâ, by characters who hate and fear them.FremenThe Fremen are the native, desert-dwelling population of Arrakis. They play a momentous role in Dune, and in the sequels.Not a history of manâs technologyHerbert was not interested in writing a novel exploring technological advances in the far future. This is one of the things which set his novel apart from most science fiction of the 1960s. Rather, he wished to tell a story about the development of human psychology, mental abilities, and religion, as man explored and colonized the galaxy. Herbert developed an interesting means of taking technology out of the story â the Butlerian Jihad. (Information about this is contained in the appendices, not much in the story itself.) The Butlerian Jihad was a war that mankind waged against âcomputers, thinking machines and conscious robotsâ approximately in the middle of the 20,000 years between our present and the time of Dune. Once man (with great difficulty) had won this war, which raged across the galaxy for a century, an edict was set forth which would thereafter govern manâs relation to technology (a Prime Directive, if you will): âThou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.â (view spoiler)[Herbert was uncannily prescient in this. In the 21st century there is growing concern with the possible consequences of increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence. (hide spoiler)]CriticismsSome readers have voiced concerns about gender issues in Dune. It does portray a galactic ruling society in which males are the dominant rulers of the Great Houses, and have both wives and concubines. Well, it is a story. The author is not espousing this model as the way a society should be set up. The Bene Gesserit society of women have awesome mental powers and clearly have engineered much of the very long range plot line of the backstory, which comes to fruition in the novel. It is also made explicitly clear in the novel that both Leto and his son Paul revere and love the âconcubineâ women that bear their sons, and hold the official wives they might marry as merely political unions (along the lines of betrothals between royalty in ages past here on Earth).So, even if you are repelled about male domination of females (which I am) I don't believe this novel will upset you....more

The six books primarily follow the aristocrat Atreides family through several generations (in fact, millennia - I read all six Frank H. books years ago). I loved them, but I was only a YA at the time. I wasn't sure I would still like them today. GFrank Herbert's science fiction novel 'Dune', first printed in 1965, is the first in his six-book series (there are books after the first six in the series, written by the author's son Brian Herbert and other collaborators after Frank Herbert's death). The six books primarily follow the aristocrat Atreides family through several generations (in fact, millennia - I read all six Frank H. books years ago). I loved them, but I was only a YA at the time. I wasn't sure I would still like them today. Good news! I did still like 'Dune'!However, those readers who prefer action-packed thrillers in which scenes resembling those movie black-ops fights with fast editing cuts predominant will not enjoy 'Dune'.The six Dune books go deep into the science and art of political leadership, especially into those practical facets of how to draw a populace into a revolution or guerrilla insurgency. Also, depending on whether your religious education is shallow or deep, some readers may pick up on the author Frank Herbert's other main theme: political classes everywhere in all times historical and present, and very likely in the future as Frank Herbert so astutely surmises, all intentionally and knowingly, develop maintain and manipulate local and world religions as a mechanism to control and direct common people into behaving as the leaders require, very much using religious believers the same way equestrians control horses through a mouth bit. Political Science majors as well as amateur political junkies and students will snicker knowingly as they read 'Dune', while the rest of us will admire the science-based, Buddhist-infused, SF genre world-building. Almost all religions around the world promise a Messiah of sorts, who at this point in our real time has come, or not, depending on the religion, so, I hesitate to describe the main character, Paul Atreides (or as I thought of him, the apostle? hehe) as similar to a Christian, Jewish or Muslim Messiah. However, some readers who are religious adherents or who are trained in those primary religions will understand quickly Paul is a Messiah character. But also understand, gentle reader, in Herbert's plot, Paul is a 'fake news' Messiah mostly created out of pre-planted hymns, myths and fake mysticism/magic displays, which have been dispersed widely for thousands of years by an organization of interstellar 'witch' women. The women act for public consumption in a combination of a very Jesuit Catholic/Buddhist guru proselytizing style, but since Herbert is a genius at hidden irony, he changes what was the work of customarily male missionaries on Earth into a girl-power production in the Dune universe.The world at the beginning of Herbert's space opera is one of competing Aristocrat 'Houses', who control planets; and the Guild, who control interstellar travel; and the Emperor, who is the military/political leader of the large and small Houses; and finally the Bene Gesserit, who are blackops fems that advise politicos on matters of religion and politics. The Bene Gesserit also specialize in Buddhist-type exercises that control the mind and body (and a secret genetics and religious Messiah program). All of these organizations are joined militarily and politically to each other through the business of acquiring a mÃ©lange, or a sort of a spice found only on one planet in the universe, the almost waterless Dune, also known as Arrakis. Spice is a miracle drug, fueling the minds of some humans who use it regularly with extraordinary mental powers of perception. Without it, the Guild navigators can't navigate through space between thousands of planets, enabling trade and travel, and the aristocrats would not be incredibly wealthy through their awarded shares of Spice profits through the Choam Company, the official Spice sales and distribution company. It follows that whoever controls the mining of Spice on the desert planet Dune, the sole source of Spice, controls also unimaginable access to power and wealth. It is the Emperor's privilege to select among the Great Houses who will be in charge of Dune. The House which is selected must also be responsible for the complete subjugation of the indigenous population, called the Fremen. The various Houses some time ago have had some success with enslaving or brutalizing the locals, but many of the toughened natives escaped and disappeared into the harsh deserts, adopting a lifestyle much like Earth's Middle-eastern tribes in the past. There also are annoying man-eating giant worms who are attracted by any noise in the deserts of Dune, so the mining of Spice deposits, only found in the deserts of Arrakis, is very tricky. No one really knows anything about the dry hot deserts, the worms or where the Spice deposits come from.The Emperor and some of the other Houses do not care what methods of subjugation are used on resident planetary populations. Some Houses use torture and slavery and starvation. Needless to say, the Atreides are good people who desire to win their subjects with love and fairness (not democracy, though). However, the Emperor and another House, the Harkonnens, do not love the Atreides because of past conflicts, and the two aristocrat houses come up with a plan to destroy the Atreides House forever. First, at least publicly, the Harkonnens are told to give up their home on Dune and to move out, and the Atreides are ordered to take charge of mining the Spice. Fifteen-year-old Paul Atreides and his mother Jessica, the Duke Leto Atreides' Bene Gesserit concubine, feel very apprehensive about the move. Not only do they feel dismay about leaving their home planet Caladan, a water-rich planet, but all the Atreides' suspect a deadly trap is being set with this supposed honor of being given the control of Dune. The Harkonnens are infamously renown for their methods of subjugation, using torture, rape and robbery freely, not caring who or how many of the indigenous population they kill. What legacy traps have the Harkonnens left behind?There are so many great reviews on Goodreads describing this fantastic novel, I find my usual graphomania has now deserted me. I will instead link to some of those fantastic reviews:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...I also would recommend reading Machiavelli's The Prince before, or definitely after, finishing Dune! However, you should be aware that my recommendation of reading the classic nonfiction book of political advice 'The Prince' (it is very short, btw) carries a hint of the creative approach Frank Herbert took in this fictional series - Paul is a moral hero, but he and his descendants also would have been easily a moral, if emotional, Vulcan Political Scientist genius in the Star Trek universe. From Paul to his children to his children's children, what had been the usual and customary practices of governance from the aristocrat Atreides House becomes instead a four-dimensional political chess game for the future of the human race. In Dune, Paul has to make tough heroic decisions which inspire his Fremen and us, gentle reader. But ultimately, sentimentality is one of the first things the surviving Atreides jettison....more

Knowing the private thoughts and reactions of relevant characters in certain scenes was often vastly more revealing than anything else could have been. The world building was simply brilliant. The universe with it's politics and intrigues grew naturally and elegantly as the book progressed. There were a number of fascinating details such as the outlawing of computers and training humans to be computer-like called Menats. I wonder how hard it would be to train us to be machine like in our thinking? There are other 'abilities' humans develop through training that I wonder about. Paul is one of my favourite characters ever written and I knew that was going to be true fairly early on. (view spoiler)[ His ""gift"" of seeing the future is fascinating and we get a proper taste of his ability near the end of this book. I was really pleased that the ""future"" seems open to change rather than everything being deeply set in fate or whatever. I'm all for some people having special roles, but I'm not a big fan of not being able to affect change even when you can see the consequences of your actions.  (hide spoiler)]I can see why this is hailed as a classic and would recommend it to anyone and everyone. Can't wait to get on with the rest of the series. One of my favourite quotes from the book:""There is in all things a pattern that is part of our universe. It has symmerty, elegance, and grace -- those qualities you find always in that which the true artist captures. You can find it in the turning of the seasons, in the way sand trails along a ridge, in the branch clusters of the creosote bush or the pattern of its leaves. We try to copy these patterns in our lives and our society, seeking the rhythms, the dances, the forms that comfort. Yet, it is possible to see peril in the finding of untimate perfection. It is clear that the ultimate pattern contains its own fixity. In such perfection, all things move toward death.""...more"

I have tried Frank Herbert's renowned series several times now but have yet to make it further than Dune Messiah, the succinct, but inferior, follow-up to his smash-hit series opener. Everything that constitutes this curiously prescient science-fiction champion appeals to me: an alluringly thoughtful and flush aeon-spanning back story; a desert planet from which is harvested the priceless spice that allows interplanetary travel; feuding and scheming noble houses within a middle-eastern-flavored interstellar Empire; human computers and gaberdine sects that have replaced forbidden machines; the super-cool Sardaukar, the soldier-fanatics of the regnant Padishah-Emperor; the young Duke with mysterious portents and genetic mysteries interwoven about his young stud self and his formidable mystic mother, and so on and so forth. It's all there for something to scratch all those itches and stoke all those fires and hoist itself up onto the same level as Tolkien's epic saga.Except that it didn't.Every time that I have returned to read this novel, I marvel at how much the first two-thirds suck me in, ramping up the tension and tautening the various strands of the conspiracy-bound storyâand the introduction of the Fremen and their austere, feral, and ritualized Neo-Bedouin culture developed amidst an endlessly severe and brutal wasteland is the most brilliant component of this story that has several. And every time I can't believe that Herbert put all of that thought and imagination and effort into this puppy only to sink it with that terribly rushed and anti-climactic ending. With whiplash haste the Baron is toast, his nephew is skewered, the Emperor is debased, the Sardaukar humbled, the Fremen ascendant, and Paul Atreides the smiling blue-eyed boy of the moment. It's the same undue haste and how-in-the-hell-do-I-wrap-this-up? palmball that he uses to hopelessly mar the ending of the already flawed Dune Messiah. The tangled plots and machinations and generational maneuvering and betrayals and...THE END! PLOTS UNRAVELED! BAD GUYS SMOKED! BLAME PLACED ON MEDDLING KIDS NOTED! NEXT!It's quite obvious that I'm in the miniscule minority hereâand I've heard similarly vehement complaints in a reverse manner from my brother concerning the good Professorâbut the palpable disappointment I feel at what I consider Herbert's lamentable inability to finish a novel at near the same level with which he constructs the back story and fleshes out the opening sections becomes so intense that it bums me right the hell out. What's more, with nearly every reader warning me that the series gets progressively more obscure and turgid the further down the chain of sequels one ventures, I have never mustered the will to crack the spine of Children of Dune, let alone the infamous God Emperor. Ah, Frank, you brilliant innovator and miscegenetic culture breeder, how magical it could have been if only you had the moxie to finish what you started....more

In fact, one of the first things that struck me about this book was the readability and fast-paced action and intrigue. So much happened in such a short amount of time, that I'd have to go back and read sections over again to be sure that I understood everything that had happened. Good stuff. I have to say that I loved Herbert's writing style. It's deceptively simple and to the point... until 10, or 30, or 100 pages later when you realize that what seemed so simple and unimportant was a set-up for a revelation later, and your brain (or mine, at least) has this little ""AHA!!"" moment, and you feel so smart for figuring out exactly what you were so expertly and subtly led to figure out. Just imagine the possibilities for multiple readings... This book is one which can be read a dozen times and still reveal hidden nuggets of goodness. Herbert's world, or universe, was so intriguing to me. I loved the political structure of having major and minor power families, an emperor, a 3rd party Guild to manage trade, and the 3rd party Bene Gesserit women, who sort of control-prophesy-manipulate to reach an end. The skills of the people inhabiting Herbert's universe are incredible, and so much based on mind-control. Not necessarily power over another's mind, although there is that, but I mean control over your OWN mind, to the point where instinctive reactions and involuntary bodily functions can be subverted and held in check, simply by will. I loved Dune, as in the planet Arrakis, and the people who inhabited it, except of course for the Harkonnen jerk-faces. The Fremen are interesting and resourceful and bad-ass and wise, and are able to accept their lot, while trying to make a better lot for future generations. We could take a page out of their books, I think. We should be improving our planet, ensuring its inhabitability for as long as we're able (at least until the sun implodes and kills us all), but instead, we're polluting with reckless abandon, as if the planet is able to just reset with each generation. Herbert's characters are some of the most interesting that I've read about as well. I loved that he infused a clear-cut Good vs. Bad struggle with deviousness and subtlety, and then on top of that, threw in characters that had to make choices that left you wondering who was real and whether they acted of their own accord or if there was something more... I loved the Atreides. They were, to me, the pinnacle of honor-bound deviousness. That seems strange to say, but I mean it in the best way possible. They were devious only to try to detect and prevent deviousness against them, and to right wrongs that have gone on for generations of animosity between houses. I do wish that there was a reason given that the Atreides house was singled out for this treatment, but reading between the lines, it seems that greed and power-mongering was the cause, and the Atreides were honest enough to stand against it, and so became the enemy. This book is one that has a great many moral and religious and life-lesson undertones, which is a fine line to walk in any book for me, as I really, really dislike being lectured to. But I think that Herbert handled this all very well, and I was able to read it without feeling as though there was a wagging finger in my face. Overall, I really, really enjoyed this book. The only reason that I am not able to give this 5 stars is that I felt like the entire book was leading up to a spectacular ending... but the ending drug on for just a bit too long and wasn't as spectacular as I'd hoped that it would be. It was a good ending to a very good book, but I felt that it just could have been a little bit more. I definitely recommend this book though. It's entertaining and informative and prescient and timely as well as timeless. Just go read it already. :)...more"

Fique de olhos bem abertos.AlÃ©m de focar bastante na forma de utilizaÃ§Ã£o e aproveitamento dos recursos naturais, durante a leitura nos damos conta de que a religiÃ£o Ã© um fator imprescindÃ­vel para o avanÃ§o da trama.E quando religiÃ£o e polÃ­tica se encontram, Ã© treta na certa. DÃ¡ para perceber logo de cara lendo-se as epÃ­grafes de cada capÃ­tulo, onde acontecimentos futuros sÃ£o apresentados e jÃ¡ vamos tendo uma breve noÃ§Ã£o de onde a obra vai parar. Eu confesso que atÃ© tinha achado isso bem estranho no comeÃ§o, mas o autor parece que vai levando o leitor de ponto a ponto na narrativa de uma maneira tÃ£o perfeita e concisa que a gente nem se incomoda muito com esses ""spoilers"" repentinos.

It is barren, almost waterless, and it is the only source of melange - a spice with unique geriatric qualities - it extends lives, enhances mental abilities, and is necessary for space travel. Dune is at the center of an Imperial scheme to bring down the influential House of Atreides led by Duke Leto Atreides. The plan is to give Leto the rights to extract spice on Dune, the rights that previously belonged to Atreides' century-long enemy - House of Harkonnen with Baron Vladimir Harkonnen as its head. The feud between the Houses is later used as a cover-up for the extermination of the House of Atreides. This plan however has a flaw, as it doesn't take into consideration that Leto Atreides's 15-year old son Paul is not an ordinary child, but the end product of a long-term genetic experiment designed to breed a super human. It's Paul's destiny to give Dune back to its native people - Fremen and to upset the power balance in the Universe. Having finished ""Dune,"" I now understand why this book is considered to be for science fiction what ""Lord of the Rings"" is for fantasy - basically, it's a standard all other works in the genre are compared against. The world of Dune has an unprecedented depth to it. Herbert creates an entire culture built around the world that simply has not enough water. This planetary condition affects Fremen tremendously - they constantly wear stillsuits that are designed to conserve and recycle bodies' water emissions, dead bodies are processed to extract water, the population is controlled to accommodate the a total amount of water available. I found this world extremely interesting and well thought out. The concepts of Bene Gesserit (a school of mental and physical abilities whose hidden mission is to advance humanity through various genetic manipulations), Mentats (people trained for supreme accomplishments of logic, human computers), Missionara Protectiva (a wing of Bene Gesserit order whose goal is to plant superstition on primitive worlds to later make these regions easier for the order to manipulate), etc. are equally fascinating. The depth of the world, however, is the biggest weakness of the book as well as its biggest strength. It takes a while to figure out various concepts and terms which are introduced early on (thankfully, there is a very helpful glossary at the end of the book). The narration is a little too dry at times, especially when characters' mental abilities are explored. The book is in many ways happens inside people's minds, so there is a lot of thinking and analyzing involved. But these negatives aside, ""Dune"" is rightfully called a masterpiece of science fiction. It is much more that a story about aliens and space travel, it is an ambitious philosophical work which explores the issues of ecology, cultural identity and the nature of religious leadership. Although I am not sure I will read the rest of the books in the series (as far as I know the total book count is now 16), I will always remember ""Dune"" as an impressive work of literature which will definitely stand the test of time.P.S. I also watched David Lynch's movie adaptation of the book. My advice - spare yourself, DO NOT watch it. ...more"

Da, zasigurno treba uzeti u obzir vremenski kontekst i kako to tada nisu bili kliÅ¡ei, ali to prosto podbada danas jer ipak sam ja ovu priÄu, ili njoj veoma sliÄnu, Äitao mali milion puta i veÄ na polovini romana sam znao kraj koji me Äeka. KliÅ¡e moÅ¾e da bude i pozitivna stvar, ako je noÅ¡en na ramenima jakih i simpatiÄnih likova, ali to je ovde prosto u nedostatku. Nadahnuto imenovani Pol je isprva definicija Geri Stu-a, savrÅ¡en i bez mane, ali ipak, nalik na odredjene pozoriÅ¡ne obrasce, i prijatelj tragedije (moÅ¾da bih, da nisam znao Å¡ta Äe se dogoditi, viÅ¡e cenio Herbertov pokuÅ¡aj da mu pripiÅ¡e tu neku zloslutnost u njegovoj herojskoj prirodi, ali ovako je efekat bio vrlo blag). Dobra porodica Atreides i zla porodica Harkonen, sa sve hrabrim Letom i grotesknim Baronom na njihovom Äelu. I tako, te neke tehnikalije i liÄniji aspekt romana, ta tradicionalna priÄa, znatno su mi umanjili uÅ¾ivanje. Greota bi bila da dam romanu tri, zato Å¡to znam da to ne zasluÅ¾uje, a mirne duÅ¡e ne mogu da mu dam ni pet. Asimov od stare garde (kojoj, istina, nisam posvetio toliko vremena) ostaje nedostiÅ¾an.p.s.

The desert planet Arrakis (where even body fluids have to be recycled through ""stillsuits"", so great is the water scarcity) is one of the most enchanting fictional worlds I have ever visited. And the story! - truly mythical in its dimension with empire, intrigue and desert warfare. I loved it all the way through."

A lot of the time though, it's more hyperbole than truth.Dune is truly epic.As always with my reviews, I won't dig into the plot overly much. The formula is classic, but with enough twists and surprises to keep you engaged to the very end. The first third starts out a little slowly; there is much to absorb and understand. Although with characters that are so alive and real that you will wonder how in the heck Frank Herbert has such a keen understanding of the human mind, it hardly matters if it slows down a little. It's a splendidly immersive experience no matter what is happening.And the quotes! The wonderful wisdom packed into every sentence! A lot of them have pervaded our vocabulary and culture so much that I had heard or even said them before knowing they were from Dune. âIf wishes were fishes, we'd all cast nets.ââI must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.ââIt is so shocking to find out how many people do not believe that they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult.âI could keep throwing amazing quotes out all day, but the point is made. This book is brilliant. It is a must read for anyone and everyone who likes Science Fiction. The amount of things it has helped inspire - from Star Wars to The Wheel of Time - is staggering. A lot of Science Fiction has trouble aging well. As technology and society advance, certain ideas or predictions seem silly or over the top and the characters don't hold up well to reality. Dune, however, is timeless. I never felt like I was reading something from a different era. It's ideas and social/political commentary are still very relevant over 50 years later. There's a reason it was one of the first epic Science Fiction novels to get published and be taken seriously. It is quite simply a stunning masterpiece - no hyperbole required....more"

Much as I am opposed to terms like world-building I can empathize and imagine. Pondering alternatives is a heady philosophical endeavor. That said, I do not like the insistence on the epic in SF/F. What I want is a Month in The Country or a Stoner on some distant world. Maybe that is why Dhalgren and Embassytown hold such appeal. I read the first 300 pages in a rush. I noted that it was the cast of Hamlet involved in the Battle of Lepanto and deciding to stage a production of Othello. Along the way Ned Stark becomes a suicide bomber. Matters sort of went downhill from there. I didnât pick up the book for a few weeks and then blew through the remaining 200 pages in two days. Lawrence of Arabia imbibes a magic elixir and becomes Harry Potter and the womenfolk just hope for the proper man, both in prophetic terms as well as totems of identity and fulfillment. Wooden dialogue muddied a clever use of stream-of-consciousness. Alejandro Jodorowsky was an ultimate influence on my reading. His unrealized cinematic adaptation was a superior vision to what was committed to paper by Herbert. Here's to my pledge that the inchoate will never be terraformed. ...more

2038810845	234225	2017-06-24	5	A genuine classic. Frank Herbert's Dune has always struck me as exemplary of intelligent, thought-provoking science fiction. In particular, this book is a narrative tale of the operation and subversion of power. A subject dear to my heart.Strongly recommend this book for all readers with a head for ideas and a desire to read something that will offer them the opportunity to think.Read in the past - catching up on the review today.

When I was seven years old I learned to read with the aid of The Chronicles of Narnia and shortly afterwards The Hobbit. These fantasy novels inspired a love of reading and also a love of wonderful worlds and adventures, a love which was further fostered when at around the same age my parents introduced me to Star Wars. Such a science fiction concept with its space battles, heroic moments and general operatic drama thrilled me to no end. At the time I had no clue that one of the major sources of inspiration for Star Wars had been Frank Herbert's Dune.So, years later I began to hunt out the inspirational science fiction works which inspired George Lucas in writing Star Wars. Which led me to a bunch of other good and not-so good books and films. Finally I came to Dune, perhaps the biggest inspiration in terms of the mix of science fiction and fantasy elements visible in Star Wars. Unfortunately I wasn't as wowed by Dune as I hoped to be. There are fantastically wonderful science fiction ideas in the novel, but they seemed to be clustered and packed around a looser story than I like. In other words it was a novel that was slightly cluttered, for it is true that too much of a good thing can become a bad thing. I guess what I am saying is that I cannot deny the influence Dune has had on the genre as a novel but it's not one of the best novels I have read. It's often rated as the most powerful science fiction novel of all time, alongside Asimov's Foundation. But what I found is that a mixture of things did not quite make the perfect novel for me such as Frank Herbert's philosophical meanderings, the slower pace and as mentioned the additional clutter.However, rather than talk on and on about what I disliked, let me talk about what I loved. Firstly I loved how Dune is essentially a novel all about one man, Paul Atreides, growing into his mystical destiny and becoming one of the natives of Arrakis or Dune. It was certainly one of the finer stories I have read about a man learning from the native tribes and becoming one of them - a story trope often copied by lesser world creators nowadays. I loved the extensive worldbuilding - the spice, the sandworms (makers), the technology, the drugs and the royal politics. I also loved the character of Paul himself, tortured and twisted as he was, he possessed a degree of depth.I have to talk about what I disliked to a small degree though. I particularly disliked how the female characters existed in this world: either as scheming manipulators or as part of a harem, women there to look good. I also did not like the characterisation of the Baron Harkonnen and can only wonder whether Robert Jordan may have based many of his own characterisations on those presented by Frank Herbert. Because some of his weaker characterisations are remarkably similar to those seen here in Dune.All in all I did strongly appreciate Dune, I just had the slightest of reservations about it in the end. And these reservations are what prevent me from pouring out my full love upon it. When everything is said it stands as a must read science fiction novel, for its influence and for what it is as a novel. For it is a brilliant mix of ideas, just not always ideas that are delivered 100 percent wonderfully....more

I'm sorry, you guys, I've let the side down. 320 pages, and I'm forced to conclude that Paul Atreides and I were never meant to be.When I admitted this to the lender of the book last night, he said some combination of ""ehh, your loss""/""BUT THE WORLDBUILDING"". And that's the thing, worldbuilding alone isn't enough for me. I felt this way about Perdido Street Station when I read it the year before last - the worldbuilding was fabulous, and similarly intricate. But I am the sort of person who enjoys shadow puppetry, who can be given a very few details, and is happy to hang the world off those and concentrate on the action. When you have that almost suffocatingly intricate worldbuilding - and yes, it is very impressive! and so is MiÃ©ville's in PSS - then you have passed the point where I can picture it, and you are headed very much towards making me claustrophobic. Dune made me feel claustrophobic, and I didn't like it. I appreciate it for the nods I've seen to it in other media - I bet Jack Glass would be even better now, there's such clear homage to it - especially in terms of the economic system. I'm really happy Frank Herbert did this thing. I just wish he'd done it somewhere else.And the rest feels old to me; it feels stale. It feels like A Christmas Carol when you've seen everyone and the Muppets do their own variations on it. It's like Dracula, terribly self-important and a genre forerunner, but with nothing that still feels fresh, all this time later. I'm glad, of course, that Dracula was written, but mostly because it paved the way for some fantastic things that came after it and because of it. It feels like a piece of backstory, something for the vampire completists. Dune also feels like that.I don't care about Paul, who is a haughty special snowflake, and with whom I can't identify. I don't care about his mother. We wouldn't be friends. There are a few characters I feel the flicker of rooting for (and ""Duncan Idaho"" is the best war hero name I've ever heard). I lost patience with Baron Von Terrible in less than a page. I don't like Arrakis, I wouldn't like to go there. So I don't feel any compulsion towards Dune for its characters' sake, much less its place in sci-fi canon.It's really odd to me, because I want to like hard sci-fi, and I think I like its defining characteristics, its direction and its outlook. Those things are all fascinating. But in a similar way, I like the characteristics and outlook of a lot of romance novels. With both sci-fi and romance, though, if I can't care for the characters, if I can't get excited about the plot, if I can't read the damn prose without something clenching in my stomach, then everything is ruined, no matter how good the idea is.It's strange, I had a similar feeling about a decade ago with Pride and Prejudice, which I later came back to and discovered was a revelation. So all is not completely lost. But in the meantime, Dune, I'm sorry. It's not you, it's me. But also it's you. We just don't have anything to say to each other.(P.S. I don't root for people with concubines. I don't, and you can't make me.)...more"

It has epic ""universe building"", a plausible ""magic"" system in the Bene Gesserit sisterhood. It has old style swordplay and futuristic intergalactic scope.I've always said it's a science fiction that reads like a fantasy. The technology is truly secondary. Once everyone gets to Arrakis, the fantastic elements take over. Herbert's prose is what makes the difference, I think. He tells an engaging story with an easy going clear language. His work is layered and has so much in it: philosophy, religion, science, morality, loyalty, cruelty, politics, espionage. It leaves the reader thinking long after closing the book.

Leyendo libros posteriores, se nota que muchos grandes autores se inspiraron en mayor o menor medida en esta saga, y no fueron pocas las veces en que alguna escena de Dune me recordÃ³ a momentos de Star Wars (se puede tararear la musiquita diciendo Dune-Dune-Dune, prueben) y de otras pelÃ­culas y series del gÃ©nero. Y si vieron la vieja serie de El Agente 86, encontrarÃ¡n en Dune que cierto simpÃ¡tico artilugio fue creado con fines serios por Frank Herbert.Â  Esta es la historia de una familia noble formada por el Duque Leto Atreides, la genialÃ­sima y poderosa Lady Jessica, y Paul, el hijo de ambos.Por orden del Emperador, y por motivos polÃ­ticos que parecen incluir una conspiraciÃ³n en contra del Duque, se ven obligados a mudarse al planeta Arrakis, un enorme y prÃ¡cticamente esteril mundo desierto que es conocido por sus habitantes como Dune. Este planeta, a pesar de su geografÃ­a hostil, es el principal productor de un bien llamado melange, o especia, que por sus propiedades geriÃ¡tricas y su relativa escacÃ©s constituye la mayor fuente de riqueza del Imperio GalÃ¡ctico. Leto estÃ¡ ahi para tomar control del gobierno de Arrakis, y esto obviamente apesta a trampa.La intriga, las traiciones, los manejes polÃ­ticos y las habilidades semi paranormales de algunos de sus personajes (con el poder que eso les otorga) son sÃ³lo una parte de lo que forma esta compleja y atrapante saga. Ya en las primeras pÃ¡ginas se establecen muchos hilos argumentales llenos de potencial que me intrigaron e interesaron. Desde el muy buen primer capÃ­tulo se pone en evidencia que Paul Atreides va a ser uno de los personajes mÃ¡s importantes de la historia, si bien durante muchos capÃ­tulos no serÃ¡ mÃ¡s que un espectador de las acciones de su padre.Paul tiene habilidades extrasensoriales heredadas de su madre, y eso lo vuelve un potencial Muad'Dib, concepto que no se va a entender realmente hasta bien avanzado el libro, pero que obviamente incluye una (muy especÃ­fica) profecÃ­a, pueblos depositando su fe en Ã©l, y por supuesto, personas poderosas intentando manipularlo.Paul es un personaje muy interesante. Me gustÃ³ desde el comienzo y sentÃ­ que era digno hijo de su madre, a quien adorÃ©. Es inteligente, sabe exactamente cÃ³mo debe tratar a cada persona y recibiÃ³ un entrenamiento tan completo como duro, preparÃ¡ndolo para suceder a su padre cuando llegue el momento. Llegado un punto me pareciÃ³ casi demasiado perfecto, sin embargo eso tiene bastante sentido una vez que se explican algunas cosas. Si bien son muchos los personajes que componen esta novela, siento que no puedo dejar de hablar del Duque Leto. No tiene tanto protagonismo como me gustarÃ­a, pero aÃºn asÃ­ me hizo sufrir mucho desde casi el comienzo, ya que muy pronto se empieza a anticipar que puede llegar a morir. Ãl es un personaje muy interesante, bastante frÃ­o, distante y calculador, pero no carente de buenas intenciones y un enorme sentido de la responsabilidad. Es de esos personajes a los que uno quiere, y punto, porque son sus acciones las que hablan por Ã©l.Mi preferida sin embargo es Lady Jessica, concubina de Leto pero no esposa por motivos polÃ­ticos. Pertenece a la orden de las Benne Gesserit âuna Hermandad de mujeres misteriosas y poderosasâ con habilidades que se irÃ¡n conociendo a lo largo del libro, y que sumadas a su personalidad, la vuelven un personaje para no perderse. Su uniÃ³n con Leto es parte de un plan genÃ©tico forjado durante cientos de aÃ±os por su Hermandad, y ella decide rebelarse y tener un hijo varÃ³n (porque ella puede elegir parece) en lugar de una mujer como se suponÃ­a que debÃ­a pasar. Es consejera, guÃ­a y compaÃ±era del Duque y su hijo, y una de las mujeres mÃ¡s geniales que encontrÃ© en los libros de Ciencia FicciÃ³n. Me encantÃ³ ver un personaje femenino tan fuerte en una historia escrita en 1960, y durante muchos capÃ­tulos me di cuenta de que me la estaba imaginando con el peinado de la Princesa Leia. Es lo que hay.Al comienzo de cada capÃ­tulo hay un pequeÃ±o fragmento semi introductorio sobre Muad'Dib firmado por la Princesa Irulan. Ella parece haberse dedicado a estudiarlo, y esos breves pÃ¡rrafos son una suerte de avance un tanto inespecÃ­fico de lo que vamos a ver en ese capÃ­tulo.Esta es claramente una de esas sagas que se comprenden mucho mejor con una segunda lectura. Muchos conceptos no van a ser explicados por bastante tiempo, y sin embargo los personajes van a hacer comentarios que muchas veces nos van a dejar un poco en ayunas. Este es definitivamente mi tipo de libro.SÃ­ debo admitir, sin embargo, que hubo algunos capÃ­tulos que me resultaron un poco mÃ¡s difÃ­ciles de leer. Hay pequeÃ±as cosas que no se si son del autor o el traductor (la traducciÃ³n es horrible), pero cada tanto algunos diÃ¡logos me parecieron rÃ­gidos y un tanto antinaturales, especialmente cuando involucraban al extremadamente desagradable Vladimir Harkonnen y sus explicaciones polÃ­ticas.Esto es algo aislado de todos modos, y probablemente mi sensaciÃ³n se deba tambiÃ©n a que leÃ­ esta novela de forma bastante salteada. Seguramente un dÃ­a lo relea en inglÃ©s, y ahÃ­ quizÃ¡s me deba retractar.Algo que no se puede dejar de destacar de Dune es la construcciÃ³n del universo.El concepto del planeta Arrakis me fascinÃ³. Ãste es un mundo que a pesar de generar la substancia mÃ¡s preciada del universo (que genera adicciÃ³n, por cierto), no conoce un bien mÃ¡s preciado que el agua. Sus habitantes, el misterioso y endurecido pueblo de los Fremen, tienen una escala de valor ""acuÃ¡tica"" en la que llorar a un muerto o escupir a alguien es una seÃ±al de gran respeto, ya que significa perder agua corporal para no recuperarla. En Dune se utilizan destiltrajes, una compleja vestimenta hermÃ©ticamente cerrada que absorve cada preciada molÃ©cula de agua que escapa del cuerpo y la recicla, convirtiÃ©ndola en potable para que el portador del traje pueda volver a beberla. Si nos ponemos a analizar un poco todo el proceso que realiza probablemente terminemos un poco asqueados, pero no deja de ser una idea brillante.Junto con los Fremen, los otros habitantes del desierto son los gusanos de arena, con los que tengo que admitir que me obsesionÃ© un poquito.

The story is also one of epic proportions - power struggle and politics between royal families while the fate of races, economies and ecologies hang in the balance. Heroes rise and monsters are revealed.The biggest reason why I am not giving this a higher rating is that I never felt invested in the characters, there was detached feeling to the writing that prevented me from really getting under the skin of the characters. There is a whopping 80-page Appendix at the end of the book that gives clarity on some of the concepts not explained clearly in the story. As I read this on kindle I didnât even know of this appendix until I finished reading and then it was a case of too little too late.And as this is high fantasy there is a lot of made up words and names to get used to. Names like MuadâDib and Feyd-Rautha and in the midst of all these foreign words this the main character and his mother is called Paul and Jessicaâ¦ a little odd.The characteristics and culture of the Fremen felt like it was based on the 14th century Arab culture during the height of the spice trades. I found this fascinating and the sections where the book focused on them almost swayed me to give the book 4 stars.I am glad I finally read this classic and can see why so many people absolutely love it but I am in two minds if I will continue the series....more

It went from being a fascinating story about Paul's mother to being a boring story about a Chosen One who just operated on instinct -- and that's the point where I quit reading. To Frank Herbert's credit, I dropped this book ages ago, yet the parts I read are still very vivid in my mind. The writing and worldbuilding were great -- but the story just didn't hold my interest.

And I did. So, I went through my mom shelf looking for something ""different"", something that was rich in writing and story. And that's when I came upon Dune. My mom was a real believer in not shielding me from the world, but also believed in not filling my mind with junk either. If I wanted to know about sex, she told me. If I wanted to know about drugs, she explained it to me. So she believed I should educate myself with books and reading and articles...anything that can give me a different view of the world. So when I asked her what she thought of Dune she said, ""EPIC!"" And that's when my obsession with Dune started. I read it five times...I re-read it over a few months and begged my mom to buy the movie. I don't remember much of the movie or the book...its been over 16 years since. All I remember is going to the store to buy the LaserDisc because we had a LaserDisc player...I thought it was the coolest thing ever.The only thing I regret is not continuing the series.

I confess that I don't know anything about Dune until three years ago when I made the active decision to explore what the science fiction genre has to offer. I researched a lot of online lists regarding the most critically-acclaimed books and Dune was the one that keeps appearing all the time so I know that it must mean something so I ventured into buying it one afternoon in August last year when my laptop's battery charger quit on me suddenly, so I was offline for the rest of the day. And my world in that moment has never been the same since I started reading it. Everything about doing so was unplanned and it couldn't have been more perfect. Just seventy-four pages in and I knew I was reading something special already.The magnificence of the novel is often subtle yet clear-cut in an inexplicable manner that leaves me at loss for sufficient words; and I am one who always knows what to say when it comes to the literature I read. So far, I've read Flowers for Algernon, Childhood's End, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, The Shrinking Man, Ender's Game, and Speaker for the Dead, sci-fi wise, and all of these books have widened my perspective and weakened me in the knees because of their unanticipated emotional impact--but none of them can compare to the enigma and sheer elegance that Dune was. A few novels are intricately beautiful, able to scar you with a lasting impression and not only does Frank Herbert accomplish that; he also elevated the genre to me, personally, into a breadth and quality that makes the world of Dune so intimately familiar to readers regardless of the futuristic setting it was created in. Written in the sixties, futuristic doesn't truly reflect the scope of this novel. The locations may be set on a different planet (the desert planet Arrakis which is supposedly rich in spice melange) but the politics, economic divisions, diversity in culture, religious archetypes and superstition somewhat resemble ours--often in the most chilling sense. But what truly sets Dune apart from other science fiction books is the absence of artificial intelligence. There are no sentient machines here. There is only a human civilization from a thousand years from now, one that is not so different from what we have now, able to develop advanced technology as well as enhance the mental and physical skills that define humans as a species that continue to thrive and evolve, both as individual and society. The world and people Herbert have created are mostly Middle Eastern in concept and influence; a great number of the terminologies in descriptions, dialogue and characterization are Arabic. There are also Islamic overtones that populate the pages but to define Dune in those simplifications alone would be insufficient. There is a varied list of religions, as well as a comprehensive explanationÂ regarding the political dynasties and technology of Herbert's creation. This is only the first novel of a timeless series that spans decades. It belongs to the subgenre of ""soft science fiction"" which usually focuses more on the social sciences (anthropology, political science, psychology) which for me is what makes Dune both less and more accessible to new readers. More often that not, when we think about science fiction, we think about AI and conflicts between humans and machines so if you're the kind of reader who enjoys these things in other mediums such as television and movies (I know I do), Dune may take some time to get used to. However, if you're one who can enjoy an expansive universe with sprawling family sagas and cultural nuances, then this book will persistently intrigue and ultimately hold you prisoner.It is a story of a mother and son foremost, and they are two of the most compelling characters in the book who readers will follow closely during their respective self-explorations and strenuous journey into the unexplored territories of the desert planet Arrakis.Â Lady Jessica is a Bene Gesserit (described as ""an exclusive sisterhood whose members train their bodies and minds through years of physical and mental conditioning to obtain superhuman powers and abilities that can seem magical to outsiders""). She is the concubine and beloved companion to the duke Leto Atreides and their son Paul was touched by a destiny that challenges the norms and comforts of the regime he is a part of. Paul and Jessica as characters and their relationship with each other remain as my favorite aspect of the story. In a sense, this book can be viewed as Paul's coming-of-age story as he slowly but surely accepts his role in spite of its overwhelming dangers and implications. No one in the book has undergone such a crucial transition than this main protagonist. Dune serves like play in three acts where the middle part is where Paul's endurance, identity and mental strength are tested and the very last act solidifies his accomplishment as the new leader of a world that is forced to keep up with him or else.I would assert that Lady Jessica is the most empowered and admirable female character I've ever read in fiction, and it's mostly because of her pragmatism, unshakable sense of self and autonomy, as well as her skills as a Bene Gesserit which for me shatters the conventions of how women (fiction and in real life) are usually perceived as emotional creatures with fickle passions and impulses. Lady Jessica stands above this, and always lets her head rule her heart but it does not make her frigid or callous. In fact, it has made her so endearing and easy to sympathize with especially whenever she makes decisions whose impact cannot be underestimated. She recognizes the power she has because of her training as a Bene Gesserit, and equips herself with it quite impressively and in service to the people she loves (like the duke and her son). However, the prejudice and negative bias towards her kind are still heavily highlighted. The Bene Gesserit are duped as ""witches"" because of the superstition that prevails among outsiders when viewing their craft from a distance. Men are always suspicious of her motives, always believing she is capable of the worst (and she is, but cautions herself against it). It's refreshing me for me as a queer woman to encounter a female character who doesn't weaponize her sexuality or deceive men for her own self-serving needs. Lady Jessica is far from perfect but she is poignantly humanized by her actions, thought processes and devotion and faith towards her son Paul. She's a remarkable specimen, that much is certain, who is wise enough to know that she can't know everything or give absolute guarantees about the things she does know.Paul and Jessica may take the center stage but other characters, supporting allies and villains alike, are just as well-rounded and memorable. I personally adored Kynes, Chani, Stilgar, Galleck Hurney and the elusive Princess Irulan who opens each chapter with excepts from her writings which set their tone. These short excerpts are reflective, often taken from various teachings and commentaries regarding science and spirituality as well as cultural analyses that the princess herself has taken a valued interest and investment in. She is only later introduced as a character by the ending chapters of the novel but her pieces throughout the book have served as narration devices which are consistently atmospheric and insightful.I would like to recommend Dune to everyone I know but I also recognize how challenging this work of fiction could be. This is not something you can pick up casually. It is the kind of book that is meant to be savored. I find that re-reading it again right after finishing it has even heightened my understanding and appreciation. The truth for the matter is the minute you start reading the first five chapters of the book, you are transported directly into the events without any kind of backstory. You just have to find your way from there and it can get confounding at times but it's also very exhilarating because the world of Dune slowly unfolds before your eyes in a small manner first (with the Atreides household moving to the Arrakis planet largely inhabited by the Fremen) until it sets up the wider stage later on. One of the most beguiling plotlines of the story is the Fremen as a desert society, and the spice melange as the source of their livelihood which is also a substance considered to be most important if not profitable. It certainly reminds me of the Spanish and Portuguese expeditions back in the day that we studied Philippine history in school, where they explored the continents to establish colonies and to look for spices (which eventually led them to my country in the first place). There are discussions about economics regarding the spice being harvested in Arrakis, as well as the cultural practices of Fremen when it comes to water, a substance they consider very much a scarcity so acquiring and preserving it involves a set of bizarre rituals.Dune is a classic for many reasons. There is just so much to consume and digest here that will not always be readily accessible so multiple readings of the entire novel itself is something I highly suggest. It gets better every time you willingly emerge yourself with the people and cultures within its pages. It took me two months to finish the first two parts. I then stopped for four months and picked this up again just last December. Its magnetic hold on me never loosened even during such a hiatus. I don't think I can compare Dune to anything else (though some could draw comparisons with a series from another genre, J. R. R Tolkien's Lord of the Rings). In that sense, just like LOTR, Dune does stand as a testament of its own making and legacy. DUNE fucking intimidates me. But I nonetheless love Dune with all my mind and spirit, heart and soul.RECOMMENDED: 10/10DO READ MY REVIEWS IN...more"

A load of the tropes that seem a natural part of sci-fi today were spawned from this series. Also, the conspiracy and drama of the power of a greedy few crushing the lives of the many is, sad to say, still incredibly relevant.Characterization is top-notch, and a horribly beautiful takedown of the 'chosen one' trope. It's hard to say in the end who has become the hero and who has become the villain, if even there are such things by then. I have to say, the character writing deserves extra praise for somehow making anyone sympathetic... or unsympathetic, depending on the situation. Paul and Jessica are the heroes who liberate the planet, but willing to do cruel things for a good end. And on the other hand, the Baron Harkonnen, who is vileness and gluttony as a person, still gets (very very) brief moments of humanity.Something that is disappointing is that there are a lot of interesting secondary characters that I feel are underused, especially on the antagonist side of things.Well, anyway, don't let the 600-page mass of book or its strange phrases scare you away, as it is a true epic in every sense, totally deserving of its status as a classic.Story - 4.5/5Characterization - 5/5Quotability - 5/5General - 5/5...more

Incidentally, it has probably become a worldwide popular novel thanks to the film adaptation David Lynch directed in the early 1980's (this movie was, and still is, not considered one of his best). Indeed, Frank Herbert wrote a novel of epic proportions, in other words a ""space opera"", with its intergalactic feudal society, its decadent (if not evil) empire and its band of rebels: the book was published some ten years before the first installment of the ""Star Wars"" series, and was obviously one of Lucas' prime source of inspiration.One of the most interesting aspects of Herbert's creation is the multi-cultural world he depicts: each ""house"" (Atreides, Harkonnen, etc.), each planet (Arrakis, Giedi Prime, Caladan...), each group (the Fremen, the Bene Gesserit, the Guild, the Emperor's suite and the Sardaukars) has its own specific flavor, its own culture, its own language, and one of the most fascinating part of this novel is probably the index at the end. For each of these cultures, Herbert has borrowed traits from the ones (ancient or contemporary) he knew well in reality, more specifically the Muslim culture. In this way, Paul Atreides / Muad'Dib's story among the Fremen makes me think of T.E. Lawrence and the Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire. In fact, the story of Paul on Arrakis is told as if it were ancient history or even a legend, through the bits of chronicles ""by the Princess Irulan"" that open each chapter.Herbert takes care to describe his fictional world and the character's actions with great detail, but I found these descriptions somewhat boring and, especially, the middle of the novel is a bit dragging because of that. In my view, however, the most impressive aspect of this novel is the dialogues (and there are many!), where Herbert consistently reveals what the persons are thinking inwardly at the same time as what they are saying. The result is a sense of duplicity and scheming in almost every interaction between characters. Each of them is always plotting one way or another, so that the whole thing ends up being like a great Shakespearean play, with dialogues and asides, tyrants and pretenders. What confirms this impression is not only the theme of the exiled Duke (see: ""As You Like It"" for instance, or even ""King Lear""), but also the repeated scenes of fencing duels throughout, with feints and poisoned tips: a clear remembrance of the final scenes in ""Hamlet"" and ""Macbeth"", to name only the Bard's most popular plays....more"

Muy bien, me dije, debÃ­a darle una probada. La historia en sÃ­ me agradÃ³. No encontrÃ© nada excepcionalmente nuevo puesto que como el libro ya tiene sus varios aÃ±os, muchas cosas de esta novela se han recreado en prÃ¡cticamente todo lo moderno. Un planeta de desierto, gusanos gigantes de arena (Â¿alguien juega a los Final Fantasy? llenos de gusanos gigantes de arena), familias con linaje enfrentadas, armas lÃ¡sers, etcÃ©tera. Lo que puedo decir es que me gustÃ³ que no fuera uso y abuso de esas cualidades de ciencia ficciÃ³n. Bien podrÃ­an haber cambiado el arma lÃ¡ser por una espada que esta novela habrÃ­a sido una de fantasÃ­a Ã©pica. Paul Atreides, nuestro protagonista, me resulta el personaje mÃ¡s difÃ­cil de definir. Es joven, tiene 15 al principio de la novela, pero actÃºa mucho mÃ¡s maduro para su edad, como todos se decantan en decir, y por ende no lo veo como un adolescente. Me cuesta mucho imaginÃ¡rmelo, a Ã©l y a su voz, y a sus muchas frases profundas y filosÃ³ficas. Siento que es un personaje incongruente y bastante insensible. (view spoiler)[Cuando muere su hijo al final de la novela, prÃ¡cticamente no siente nada. Fue como una brisa al pasar. Â¡Y era su hijo! (hide spoiler)]Jessica fue mi favorita. La madre de Paul, una Bene Gesserit (no me pregunten quÃ© es eso), una mujer fuerte, independiente y con una voz de acero. Su papel en la historia es casi tan importante como el de Paul, e incluso me hace pensar si no es la co-protagonista del libro. Los demÃ¡s, para mi gusto, fueron simplemente nombres. Algunos habitantes de Arrakis (Dune) me cayeron muy bien, como Chani y Stilgar (a pesar de que su participaciÃ³n es bastante pequeÃ±a), y algunos antagonistas, como el BarÃ³n Harkonnen, me parecieron muy bien creados. Harkonnen es uno de los villanos mÃ¡s crueles que me crucÃ©, al punto de mandar a matar a cualquiera por el simple hecho de que su vaso estaba medio lleno o medio vacÃ­o (por un decir). Todo el resto, Gurney, Duncan, Kynes, fueron una sucesiÃ³n de nombres sin mucha importancia para mÃ­, y al fin y al cabo no hacen a la historia para nada, aunque el autor insiste en darles protagonismo. De hecho ahora mismo pocos nombres recuerdo de personajes secundarios. Ay, ay, ay. Crear un planeta nuevo no es nada fÃ¡cil. Las cosas en Arrakis estaban bien, me gustaba todo eso de los habitantes de allÃ­, con sus ojos azules, la especia o melange, los gusanos de arena, las tormentas... era un desierto al fin y al cabo, no es que nos encontramos con Ã¡rboles rosas y un cielo verde. Mi problema estÃ¡ en que Â¿quÃ© pasÃ³ antes? Â¿Por quÃ© la melange (que si entendÃ­ bien, era canela) se volviÃ³ el bien mÃ¡s preciado del universo? Â¿Desde cuÃ¡ndo hablamos de un imperio universal, cuyos feudos abarcan planetas? Â¿QuÃ© pasÃ³ con la Tierra? En Arrakis hay escasez de agua, pero con todas las medidas que los personajes toman (ademÃ¡s de que se trata de personajes adinerados, por lo que siempre tienen lo Ãºltimo en tecnologÃ­a) la falta de agua parece un mito. No lo sentÃ­ real a esto tampoco, a esta necesidad de beber algo cuando el sol de un desierto te azota. Crear una distopÃ­a o algo de ciencia ficciÃ³n (situado en un futuro) es un tema muy delicado. Hasta ahora no he encontrado ninguna historia que responda a esas preguntas previas. Me siento traicionada, o quizÃ¡ es que en realidad nadie se pregunta esas cosas y a nadie les importa contestarlas. *llora*AY, FRANK HERBERT. TENÃA ESPERANZAS PUESTAS EN TI.Muy chato. Muy chato todo. Se narraban acciones nada mÃ¡s, de la psique de los personajes ni hablemos, solo por diÃ¡logo. Y repeticiones a mansalva. ""Se alzÃ³ de hombros"", ""MirÃ³ a tal (para introducir diÃ¡logo)"", hojas y hojas de conversaciones mÃ¡s que de narraciÃ³n... asÃ­ no puedo. Todos los personajes hablan iguales (ese estilo antiguo, educado, elevado), asÃ­ que estaba difÃ­cil diferenciar cuÃ¡ndo hablaba quiÃ©n en caso de no poner acotaciones. HabÃ­a momentos en los que realmente no sabÃ­a quÃ© estaba pasando en la historia o cÃ³mo habÃ­an caÃ­do los personajes ahÃ­ o por quÃ© contestaban tal cosa a tal otra. Es como si lentamente se quiere ir deslizando informaciÃ³n para que vayamos entendiendo pero al final en realidad no entendiste nada y no te explicaron nada. Bonito.Algo que debo marcar es la ediciÃ³n de este libro (que es la que tengo puesta acÃ¡, en Goodreads). Si pueden, no la compren. Nunca me crucÃ© con un libro tan mal editado, ni siquiera mis quejas con Ciudad del Fuego Celestial le hacen justicia. Errores ortogrÃ¡ficos (horrores horrogrÃ¡ficos mejor dicho), tildes que NO iban, palabras mal escritas pero de forma monumental, como ""homros"" en vez de ""hombros"". Todos los pronombres personales que se refieren a ""Ã©l"" (no el artÃ­culo, sino el pronombre personal) lo escribieron sin tilde. HabÃ­a cosas que con un simple corrector de Microsoft Word se arreglaban. De repente te encontrabas leyendo un pensamiento de un personaje que normalmente va en cursiva en los libros, y cuando esa idea terminaba, descubrÃ­as que todo el pÃ¡rrafo, que ya no era el pensamiento del personaje sino narraciÃ³n, tambiÃ©n estaba en cursiva.

Creo que la mayor parte de la nota va por Jessica, porque me pareciÃ³ genial, porque es madre, porque es mujer y porque la mina le patea el trasero a todos los demÃ¡s personajes, incluyendo a Paul. Al principio de cada capÃ­tulo tenÃ­amos un fragmento de algÃºn libro sobre Muad'Dib escrito por una tal ""Princesa Irulan"". Lo lindo es que cada uno de esos fragmentos tienen algo de hilo conductor, y al final de la novela todo cierra perfecto. Me gustan esos finales que dejan a la novela hecha una perfecta circunferencia ingeniosa. Ciertamente no sabÃ­a con quÃ© encontrarme en esta historia. La sinopsis no era muy clara.

CuestiÃ³n, esperÃ© peleas llenas de luz lÃ¡ser y sangre, esperÃ© carreras contra el tiempo, esperÃ© supervivencia y situaciones lÃ­mite, y me encontrÃ© con algo totalmente distinto, pero no menos satisfactorio. Esta historia, despuÃ©s de todo, no es Star Wars. AsÃ­ que tres estrellitas y media. (Goodreads, habilitame las medias estrellas por favor)P.D.: NO vean la pelÃ­cula. Es muy mala y vieja y bizarra.

As for the other characters there were a lot of interesting ones which I hope to learn more of in the future books since they seem very interesting SPOILER ALERT SO DONT READ THIS UNTIL YOU'VE READ THE BOOK DUH(view spoiler)[and there were some I wish I could see more of but cant because of them being dead such as Dr Kynes, Yueh, Duncan and others but we shall see what the future books have in store  (hide spoiler)]SPOILER END FOR THE PEOPLE WHO USE THE APP BECAUSE ITS BEING ANNOYING WITH SPOILERSBut if I had a problem I did find the way the characters spoke a bit weird which put me off when I tried to read this when I was younger since it felt like a chore to know what everyone was speaking and it just feels something so complex seriously can you not just speak like a normal human being please this ain't Shakespeare or something I know your noble and all but.....shut up also I'm not gonna add a quotation as evidence because I'm lazy sooooo read itOkay now the best part of the book for me is drum roll please..........ARRAKIS-DUNE-DESERT PLANETLet me explain its obvious that the author put a lot of his attention into building this world where theres nothing but deserts and there are many dangers such as sandworms, heat and other stuff that could kill you and I liked how he put soo much of his attention on how dangerous the world is and how the characters try to survive it rather than the flashy technology spacecraft star wars mumbo jumbo you get from the other stuff also I love the fremen as well since they have an Arabic influence to them (hell some of the words used are Arabic with some being close to the meaning than others) and it was interesting to learn about these people and how they live with the survival of the fittest rule and learning about there harsh reality was really fascinating to me and I'm glad the author decided to put his focuses in these areas since this is what made my experience so much better.Overall with some hiccups it 5/5 what a book this was and I'm glad I finally read now it is time to move on to the film and other books in the series since this was great and for my first science fiction novel I loved it soo much and cannot wait to see more books in the genre soon....more"

He wrote numerous others to follow it, all of which continue to explore and flesh out the world he introduced us to in this, the first of his Dune series. The world in its pages is so vast and so rife with potential that his son, Brian, has continued in his father's footsteps, writing further explorations of the history that led up to this book. Dune introduces its readers to a planet called Arrakis, a desert world populated only by the occasional smuggler, swarthy profiteer, and a mysterious, scattered, and ferocious race of humans known as the Fremen. Arrakis is known and recognized in the universe only due to its primary and sole export: a highly addictive, mind and reality-altering drug called the Spice. Spice has made the relative backwater planet of Arrakis a point of universal focus, with collection and supply of the drug of utmost importance to millions. This collection, however, is hampered by Arrakis' only large (and I do mean ""large"") native life-form, massive, eyeless, impervious creatures referred to (in awe, loathing, and terror) as ""worms"". Spice production is an incredibly dangerous business, as worms are drawn to any sound upon the sand. They ""hear"" the vibration of anything that moves across the sand-washed surface of the planet, responding quickly and with deadly ferocity, tearing apart and/or swallowing whole entire ships, large machinery, or, if you're stupid or unlucky enough to be stuck out there solo on the sand, the occasional human being.The elite of the universe, whom Herbert has crafted within a highly detailed, incredibly complex social structure and political strata, view Spice both as a luxury and a necessity, craving its affects both because they love it and because they must have it once they become addicted. Travel between planets is restricted to ships staffed and propelled by the Guild, ruthless interstellar businessmen who have taken Spice-addiction to a high unlike that ever experienced by others: they use Spice to literally bend space and time, moving spaceships, goods, and anything else that is paid for from here to there in the blink of an eye. They too rely on Spice for everything they stand for.Throw into this mix an interstellar order of monastic witches called the Bene Gesserit (who through gene manipulation across thousands of years have sought to fulfill an age-old prophecy of a girl-child who would become one who could change and control the universe), and things get even more interesting. This book is thick with treason, passion, wickedly intense political and familial warfare, complex social and spiritual explorations, and profound mystery. Herbert doesn't just create his own world with the Dune series: he creates a singular universe, an existence within which his own faiths and religions profoundly affect and shape his version of what humans will one day become. It's an amazing book, and I encourage you to read the others that follow, as well. They get more and more bizarre and utterly unique as they progress, but all are satisfying experiences.Before I read this book, I saw the 1980's movie adaption, featuring the likes of Kyle MacLachlan, Sting, Patrick Stewart, Sean Young, and even an uncredited minor appearance by David Lynch. As a result, reading this book afterward was filtered through the visual and representational understandings/interpretations offered to me by the film. This was both a good and bad thing. The movie leaves out and simplifies a ridiculous amount of the subtle, many-layered wonders of Herbert's world, and does disservice at times to the characters Herbert created. As a sci-fi escape from reality, however, I didn't mind the movie at all. Read the book, and then watch the film if you can find it.Primarily, however, read the book....more"

How's this for subtly introducing the identity of a new character:âIs it not a magnificent thing that I, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, do?âTo which my initial reaction was: Is it not a shit thing that I, the reviewer Warwick Wise, read? Nevertheless, there is a certain charm to it all, the characters are a lot more than cardboard cutouts, and the world-building, prefiguring everything from Star Wars to Game of Thrones, is complex and excellent.The story itself is a very classical hero-narrative (deliberately so â Herbert was a big fan of Joseph Campbell), which moves slowly but has all kinds of interesting details. Perhaps surprisingly, it felt to me like a real product of the 60s in many ways, with a central role given to mind-altering substances and an important ecological theme âÂ the book is dedicated to âdry-land ecologistsâ. (Dune was popularised among the countercultural community after being included in Stuart Brand's Whole Earth Catalog, in a completely unexpected link with my other recent reading.) But all of these factors also make it quite relevant today, not least the depiction of a religiously fanatical desert community being exploited for the hugely profitable substance found by drilling into the sands. Those are all just added extras, though â if you don't enjoy the prospect of a big, sprawling political science-fiction saga then you're not going to get much out of the various subplots.This Folio Society edition is kind of gorgeous, featuring these absolutely exquisite illustrations from Sam Weber, as well as a badly-written afterword from Brian Herbert which does not incline me to read the later sequels he wrote from his father's notes. I probably should have read this twenty years ago, but I'd still consider it a good, foundational piece of sci-fi, which sheds light on several aspects of the tradition and can still be enjoyed plenty for its own sake.

They have been using religion to ease the way for their own goals and ambitions; however, what happens when prophecy is ultimately fulfilled? This is what makes Dune special ... the fulfillment of prophecy and the downfall of Empires.

There's a lot going on in the book, and there's been a lot going on in my life, so coherency might not be forthcoming.Dune is intricate, at times confusing, allegorical and meticulously researched story. Even though I didn't fall in love with the characters, I fell in love with the book. It's easy to see how Dune is a classic, often imitated.I loved this book, but at least one of my GR friends who I greatly respect hated this book. Which is fine, because, hey, we all have different tastes. (And thank Odin we've got diverse authors and genres for all types!) But I couldn't help ponder which attributes might make Dune so disliked. Sure, it's long, it's complicated, and has a pretty big cast of characters. And despite the Reverend Mothers and their power, the book has that overall masculine appeal - testosterone in overdrive. I don't mind that, but I can see how it could bother some readers. But I think there might be other factors that would cause people to not just dislike, but really hate Dune. My hypothesis, (which I admit is most likely completely wrong, but I'll put it out there anyhow): Dune will only be loved by hard-core science fiction fans. I don't mean this in any derogatory way, since science fiction doesn't and can't appeal to all tastes. And that's quite all right by me.A year ago, Jo Walton wrote about a concept that she attributes to Samuel R. Delany, specifically from his book The Jewel-Hinged Jaw: Notes on the Language of Science Fiction. The thesis is that science-fiction has it's own language and protocols. From Walton's essay:""He then went on to say that one of the ways of approaching SF is to look at the way people read itâthat those of us who read it have built up a set of skills for reading SF which let us enjoy it, where people who donât have this approach to reading are left confused.""For SF fans, it's fun to read a story and not fully understand the language, the technology, the aliens, or what have you. And Dune is extremely challenging in this regard. The desert dwellers, the Fremen, have a culture that can be shocking and overly practical to us Earth-dwellers. There is a whole language and terminology invented, complete with a glossary included with the book. Herbert drops facts about a pre-history into the readers lap as if the reader already has knowledge of those events. It's a challenge to read, and not all readers would find those challenges ""fun.""Other fun things in Dune: Huge sandworms! Blue eyeballs! ""Do as she says, you wormfaced, crawling, sand-brained piece of lizard turd!"" Prophesies! Water-reclamation technologies!OK, now that I've thoroughly pissed off my non-sci-fi-loving friends, let's totally shift gears here. In my 40th Anniversary Edition, there is a afterword written by Frank Herbert's son, Brian Herbert, who has written many of the Dune sequels. Here's a few of the more fascinating revelations in his essay:* ""When he was a boy, eight of [Frank Herbert's] Irish Catholic aunts tried to force Catholocism on him, but he resisted. Instead, this became the genesis of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood.""* Herbert researched over a 4-year period, 1957-1961, then wrote the book between 1961-1965. The book was rejected by all the major publishing houses, but was finally picked up by Chilton, the publisher of all those car-repair manuals.* Sometimes Herbert would write passages first in poetry, before he expanded and converted them to prose.* Herbert took some inspiration of the Paul Maud'dib character from Lawrence of Arabia - the outsider who helped lead a desert revolt in Turkey in WWI....more"

It isnât a selective grouping either. A totally random swath of people Iâve known have considered Dune to have had a very formative role in their growth; one, in particular, credits it with her move away from conservative religion. It is a really big deal to some people.While I donât feel like reading Dune changed my life, I did really enjoy it. I suspect I partially enjoyed it just due to contrast. I felt so unstimulated by the Foundation Trilogy that I was thrilled to read something where a âheroâ was doing something. It allowed for the âI can change the worldâ fantasy transposition of reader and main character that I was missing in the Foundation books. I think that having a cast of characters who are active in the whole of the book was an important factor in drawing me into the story.I also enjoyed it for the richness of the world. Thatâs where most of the âscienceâ in this fiction was found, and I find myself more drawn to science as I mature. [In fact, I have been disappointed thus far; I want more science, less fiction.] I have to constantly remind myself while reading through the books on this list that these were, presumably, the first books to use these concepts. Frank Herbert made a universe, complete, from Space Guild to sand plankton. Even after years of reading other stories by authors who have done the same, I can still appreciate the depth of thought and idea behind Arrakis and its surrounding universe. I donât know if Iâve ever read a book which had as great a handle on the ecology of the world in which is was set; if I were pressed, I can only think of Grass by Sherri S. Tepper as coming close.Equally impressive was his treatment of religion. I especially liked the appendices, which moved even deeper into the evolution of religion over time. Herbertâs answer to how religion [and culture] evolved over the millennia[s] since âOld Earthâ is similar in concept to the answer Joss Whedon gave with Firefly. Herbert saw the future as blend of Middle Eastern and Western ways; Whedonâs future is China/America. Being that his focus was religious as opposed to say, economic, this is understandable. It may even have been more base than that. Possibly he chose that direction because Arrakis is most similar to our desert regions where Islam originated, but I think it has more to do with cultural impact than mere climatic coincidence.I think one of the strongest elements is the writing itself. Itâs very well written. Although I had been exposed to 2 movie versions of Dune prior to reading it, almost none of the previous imagery colored my mental image of what the characters and settings were supposed to look like. Weaker writing would have easily allowed my perceptions to be molded by the theatrical versions. I really hate when that happens. I donât even know how I used to imagine Harry Potter looking before the movies came out. If Paul Atreides looks like anyone in my head that Iâve seen visually, Iâd tell you he looks like this kid I went to school with [coincidentally named Paul Strange] [anybody remember that kid?] albeit much more attractive....more

I have to say I didn't know a great deal about Dune before going into it other than that it had big sand worms things and was considered a 'classic' in the SF genre. I think not knowing much about it meant that I assumed it would be something very different to what it was. In my opinion this whole story felt a bit like a weird mash-up between the sci-fi setting and different races/planets and a very fantastical magical prophetic situation and story. When I entered into this I thought we'd be seeing a lot more of a focus on the science and technology, but actually this was more driven by betrayal and magic and politics, which was interesting, but far from what I think many would have envisioned.With that said, I think that had I known it was more of a sci-fi/fantasy mash-up going into it I might have enjoyed it more. I do think that the political undercurrents that we see being laid out at the start are pretty well handled and interesting, and that our main character, Paul, is a fairly unique character right away. My main criticism was that prophecy is always something which can easily become a 'get out of jail free' card and can be used to 'conveniently' fix things or make things happen, and I did think that this book suffered a bit for that.The book is set on a desert planet where there are lots of massive sand Dunes and very little hospitable areas for plants or life. Water is a very rare commodity and most people on the planet haven't got enough of it and so it's largely used by workers to harvest and tend to a special kind of spice which is grown there. We follow the Duke and his lover, Jessica, and son, Paul who are told to look after and watch over the planet by the Emperor at the start of the story and so they fly there with the intention of doing so but quickly become ensnared in the games and plots which are already in motion. As it goes on Paul and Jessica become the two major focuses as they are both highly trained, have gifts and seem to be fairly independent and intelligent. On the whole I think that seeing the Fremen and their culture living on the water-deprived planet was some of the most interesting sections for me. The Worms didn't appear anywhere near as much as I though they would, and yet they were pretty important to the plot at some points. I think that the story suffered a little from too much prophecy and peculiar magic trying to fit into a modern and desolate SF landscape. It could have been a much more cohesive plot had this been a little less or more subtle. Overall I would give this a 2*s because it's an okay book and it's certainly not that hard to get into and read, but at no point was I truly fascinated or enjoying it more than anything else I have read recently. It's a book which has a plot that I found somewhat exciting at points and not at all at others, and had character who were interesting at moments, and irritating at others. It's hailed as a classic SF book and yet I think maybe by modern immersion standards it didn't quite hold up for me... 2*s overall....more

I haven't heard it said for this novel and for good reason, I believe. Herbert didn't draw upon existing archetypes to flesh out his story, He created completely different new ones. Herbert's vision was such that in his far-flung future, not only did he imagine how technological and socio-economic circumstances might change, which are defining factors for the SF genre, he drafted how consciousness itself would evolve. The characters in Dune may resemble some sort of Jungian / Campbellian hero vs. anti-hero but, their actions, thought patterns and mannerisms are effected by 10 thousand years of evolution. The same amount of time has elapsed since we as Cro-magnon stepped on the recently thawed lands as the last ice-age receded. Herbert is able to draft these neo-humans not in a different, alienating light either. There is much in these characters that is to be admired, envied and adored. Paul Atreides, the main crux and fulcrum of the novel, is attempting to follow a dangerous path in life as he finds he has the choice to evolve even further to what very well may be a 'godhead.' Fueled by revenge for his father and hounded by his enemies and the very environment that surrounds him, he plays with fire as he discovers new found powers his perceptions of the universe offer him. Guiding him is his mother, Jessica. She is the bound concubine of Duke Leto, Paul's father and a powerful priestess in a secretive sisterhood, the Bene Gesseret. She guides Paul to his new found provenance by instructing him in the secret ways of mind and body control espoused by the sisterhood. They both are refugees on the intolerable planet Arrakis, or Dune, where no rain falls and the planet is swathed in inhospitable dessert. They find unlikely allies in the Fremen, indigenous peoples of the dessert who live by hard means and hard ways. All of this is surrounded by a backdrop of plausible political intrigue and complicated detante, certain morality tales and sub themes and action - that in perfect Herbert Style - hits the ground running.If you have seen the David Lynch movie version or perhaps the sc-fi channel's mini-series adaptation, I still recommend you read this book. I would gather that about 85% of what occurs in the novel is purely cerebral and cannot be expressed visually. Besides, how could anyone hand over the muscal them for Muad `Dib, the Kwisatz Haderach to some washed up band like Toto? (Although, I do have to admit they did a good job of it.) You should read this book!! If you don't own a copy, or do not intend on buying one. Get a hold of me and I will send you one....more

Coming at it some 50 years after its publication date made the impact of this a little less impressive as some of the main ideas here have been seen multiple times in other works since, compared to if I was coming at it from publication date. Things that canât be taken away from this and are still really impressive are the sheer scope and depth of the world building and the cultures that inhabit Arrakis, quite often overshadowing the main events that are unfolding in the plot.  The main story will be known by most as this has been around for some time and has even been adapted to both film and tv series. The book is split into 3 books of their own right which gave the overall feel of this somewhat as a condensed trilogy: The first book laid the foundations and gave the principle characters time to shine. I originally struggled to get into the book with all these tricky names and cultures I was unfamiliar with but when Iâd got past the learning curve I began to enjoy things. There was political intrigue as to what was to occur on the new planet that House Atreides was moving to, also why the Duke was so ready to accept something that seemed so obviously a trap, even so that the Duke knew it himself. The characters were fleshed out enough to make them interesting but yet not enough to make you really care if any of them were struck down. The main bad guy was pretty terrible though. The ending of this book was somewhat bizarre and instantly drew me in to the next one. The second book was where things took a downward turn for me. The pacing became glacial with nothing major happening and I was worried that the promise of the first book would be lost. The characters didnât have enough about them to keep things going on their own and the plot was all geared around Paul and his new abilities. This is when I felt it truly was like a mini trilogy as the 2nd books always seem to slow building events for the final book.Which brings us neatly to the end. I wasnât expecting the shift in time but it didnât alter the fact that this book had more going on straightaway than the entire last book. Things really picked up and I was unable to put it down until completed. Everything was rounded off nicely with enough interest to take me to the next book at a later date. So whilst not the best read of the year I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and would pick up the next in the series to see how things progress. A special shoutout has to go to the people I read this with in my first âbuddy readâ who offered their views and thoughts which added to the whole experience.

It's inspiration which I won't mention seems to be as relevant today as it was the day Herbert put pen to paper. The conflict within this world is extreme and the stakes are high. In that regard, there are thriller aspects to the story with a clear hero and villain. The hero is also in jeopardy from what seems like page one until the end. The great part about Herbert's compelling narrative is that we don't just want to know what is next, but also why. He gives us a great ride and makes us think. We're forced to think about the created world, but also how our own morality and values fit in. This is why Dune is not just a great Sci-Fi novel, but also a living, breathing entity that changes and grows with us. Greatness comes from its survival and relevancy across generations, but also how it manages to ask relevant questions to all of us, no matter the year. Last, but certainly not least, Dune is a highly readable and highly approachable novel. It lacks some of the density of GRRM and JRRT, but doesn't lack for narrative drive or a highly compelling protagonist. I couldn't wait to get to the next page. I recommend this for sci-if, fantasy fans, but also folks who are fans of thrillers but are open to having them set in something other than a realist setting. At almost 900 pages, it is still a page turner. ...more

In my first review, which I craftedSecond review (Reviewed on February 12, 2011).Dune is a classic because it tells a classic story well. It combines two plots that I love: a vast political intrigue with an intimate family conflict. The Atreides and Harkonnens are related by blood; their feud is a blood feud going back generations. Yet their battles are political in scale, using vassals as soldiers and spies in an interstellar chess game where the throne of the Imperium itself is within reach. In my first review, which I crafted hastily one day when I added this book to Goodreads, I pontificated on the role of science fiction as a setting rather than a genre. Frank Herbert chose to set Dune far into the future and across the galaxy. There are spaceships, shields, lasguns, and of course, the all-important spice. Yet, I argued, this changes nothing. Dune is not a classic work of science fiction; it is a classic, period.I stand by this, and while I do not want this review to be a rehash of the first, I want to elaborate further. It has been at least five years since I last read Dune, and I knew going into this reading that I would see it differently, since I'm now an adult, with more experiences and more science-fiction books under my belt. Though nominally science fiction and science fiction and fantasy in its setting, at its heart Dune is an epic, a tragedy reminiscent of ancient Greece and pre-Enlightenment Europe.House Atreides and House Harkonnen are embroiled in a bitter blood feud, and now that feud seems to be coming to an end in the form of a political gambit by the nefarious Baron Harkonnen that results in the destruction of Duke Leto Atreides, his family, and his new fiefdom on the desert planet of Arrakis. Backed by the Emperor, the Harkonnens seemingly wipe out House Atreides and re-assume control of Arrakis, the only planet known to produce spice. Spice is a panacea known for its geriatric properties, but more importantly, it is the only substance that gives Spacing Guild navigators the prescient visions required to navigate through folded space. Without the spice, interstellar travel would be limited to relativistic speeds. Hence the oft-repeated mantra: whoever controls the spice, controls the universe.Aside from the occasional mention of sandworms and spaceships and lasguns, this could be set in Tudor England or fifteenth-century France. The Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV does exactly what kings of old used to do; he pits his nobles against each other so they do not succeed in uniting to depose him. His downfall comes from underestimating House Atreides and the Fremen inhabitants of Arrakis who align themselves with the fugitive Atreides scion, Paul, also known to them as Muad'Dib. He becomes a messiah for the Fremen, a dangerous figure indeed, and in so doing discovers he has triggered a revolution he cannot fully control, even with his newfound powers as the Kwisatz Haderach, the culmination of a Bene Gesserit breeding program.I paid more attention to Paul's role as a messiah this time around. When I was younger, I didn't fully understand the ramifications of this role. (I remember rejecting Dune Messiah the first time I tried to read it because ""it seemed to religious""!) Thanks to the two Sci-Fi channel miniseries that rekindled my interest in Dune, these ramifications are much more obvious. They inform the rest of the story, acting as a pivot point around which crucial events revolve. Paul's role as a messiah accords him great influence, great powerâbut as a role, it also restricts his choices as much as his visions of the future does.What's amazing is how close Baron Harkonnen comes to winning. Paul might have chosen to live out his days among the Fremen rather than win back his dukedom (and more), but he doesn't. Jessica even urges him to do this at one point, but it is clear the decision is less Paul's than it is the Fremen. They were set upon this path long before the Atreides came to Arrakis, back when Pardot Kynes and his son, Liet, commenced a centuries-long ecological transformation plan. They hate the Harkonnens perhaps as much as Paul does, are eager to raid against the Harkonnen forces, so they wouldn't take ""no"" as an answer; if Paul were to take the safe course, he would not find acceptance among them. Finally, Paul-Muad'Dib is their messiah, the Lisan al-Gaib. There are prophecies about him, and having demonstrated his authenticity as the messiah, he must fulfil them.Above all, Paul states several times he rejects the ""temptation"" to take the safer path. That's how his prescient visions manifest themselvesâas potential paths the future could take, always twisting and snarling and reforming as each choice he makes changes that vision. He sees safer routes, but these, he says, lead only to stagnation. These are the routes the Guild navigators take, which has resulted in the Guild morphing into a parasite on the back of the Imperium. Having acquired prescience, Paul sees the potentialities for the human species, and he realizes he has the ability to effect change. But he has to be careful, because to know the future is to become trapped by it, even as one changes it.I guess I just have a soft spot for tragic heroes. I like watching heroes fall, because it reaffirms their humanity by the very fact that, despite their larger-than-life actions, they are flawed. This is important when it comes to Paul, because as the Kwisatz Haderach, he has become something posthuman, more-than-human. He is colder, slightly more divorced from his surroundings, because he is mediating both the present and the many-futures. It would be a mistaken to say he is disconnected, though, for it is clear he still loves and cares for Chani; rather, he is heavily burdened by his roles and responsibilities. We don't see his actual fall in this book, but the seeds of it are thereâas Irulan says, every revolution carries with it the seeds of its own destruction. Herbert foreshadows the trials Paul will face: the uncontrollable storm of revolution; his increasing alienation from those close to him, like Gurney and Stilgar and even his mother; and of course, opposition from external forces, such as the Bene Gesserit and the former Padishah Emperor.A great hero deserves a correspondingly great villain, and the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen certainly fits this description. He is an intriguing counterpoint to Muad'Dib. Like Paul, the Baron is depicted as somewhat inhuman, but in his case it's because of his obese figure and his profound cruelty. This guy has his nephew murder the entire house seraglio as a punishment for discovering his nephew's crude plot to murder him! He will stop at nothing to get what he wants, and his wants are many, varied, and perverse. His flaws, however, get the better of him. As a result of his overindulgence and his arrogance, the Baron ignores the real threatâthe Fremen and their messiah, Muad'Dibâwhile spending too much time counting all the riches he'll have and plotting to make his nephew emperor. His downfall is as much his own as it is Paul's (or, as the case may be, Alia's).So Dune has a great hero and a great villain. It also has plenty of morally-ambiguous characters who span the spectrum between. Jessica Atreides and Thufir Hawat fall into this category. Jessica was supposed to bear a daughter for the Bene Gesserit, who would in turn give birth to a Harkonnen son who might become the Kwisatz Haderach. They did not expect her, out of love for Duke Leto, to give birth to a son; they did not expect Paul's latent psychic abilities to come into full force through ingestion of spice. As a result of this act, Jessica irrevocably alters the Imperium. Though she claims she never regrets her decision, it is obvious that she struggles with her role as a Reverend Mother among the Fremen and how she influences Paul's actions. She is torn between being a mother and a Reverend Mother, between her son and her leader, her new duke.Hawat is captured by the Harkonnens while still labouring under the false impression that Jessica is a traitor. Reluctantly, he works for the Harkonnens while seeking a way to destroy them. In this role as a captive Mentat, we see Hawat become trapped, unable to destroy his new patrons but unwilling to forgive them or abandon his desire for vengeance. His manipulations of the Baron and the Baron's nephew bely his supposedly tamed status, but he has lost someâperhaps even mostâof his edge; he is broken, if not beaten.I'm not sure what else I can say about Dune. It is a classic and a masterpiece because it takes a form and formula that are timeless and lays over this framework complex characters who struggle against each other and the circumstances in which they find themselves. Paul Atreides is a duke's son who becomes a desert fugitive, a reluctant warrior, and the figurehead of a revolution. Surrounding him are friends and family who soon begin to slip away, and enemies who underestimate him even as they plot to destroy his life and all that he holds dear. It's a story we've told time and again, but Herbert puts it in space, throws in some sandworms, and adds a little spice. Consequently, Dune stands on the shoulders of stories that have come before it, attaining its greatness because it is something both recognizable and unique.First review (When Added to Goodreads, Last Read Pre-Goodreads).Many people hear the words ""science fiction"" and run away in terror. They labour under the erroneous idea that science fiction must be some sort of fantastic space opera in which there are laser blasters, warp engines, teleportation, and all that jazz. Thanks in part to Star Wars, Star Trek, and the improvements of the special effects industry, science fiction is reduced that narrow category.So what is science fiction? Science fiction is a setting, not a story. And no book better demonstrates this than Frank Herbert's Dune. Yes, Dune is set in the future (the distant future). Yes, there are spaceships, other planets (in fact, Earth isn't around any more), and bizarre things like prescience. But once you accept these and move on to the actual story, you'll find that it is an epic, dynastic tale of political intrigue. It's set in the future, but the environment is distinctly feudal. Frank Herbert incorporates a dazzling array of motifs, such as religion, drugs, ecology, rebellion, and prophecy.Whenever I read Dune, I can't help but think about how big it is. The Dune universe operates on such a magnificence scope that it's hard to believe it came from the mind of one man. The story is timeless, because it is about the human condition: betrayal, love, murder, avarice--all of the characters exhibit the best and the worst of human emotions. In fact, Dune is devoid of alien intelligences. This isn't about humanity versus the Martians. It's about human versus human, one person pitting his or her intelligence against another. It's about the sacrifices necessary to achieve power or save a loved one.Dune is a classic, a masterpiece of fiction, regardless its genre....more"

Throughout the book, you're mostly given the look into the minds of people who are using intellect to force the body and emotions into behaving appropriately. It's all master-planners and chess players and people who are one with the force... oops, wrong story. There are moves and countermoves and layers and layers of subtext. It's an absolutely masterful novel of the intellect. Unfortunately this meant that I never connected emotionally to the characters or events, and politics and chess are exhausting to me. Actually, the book was like all muscle with no fat, which perfectly describes the Fremen themselves.I do feel that where other writers have an idea, this guy must have had some kind of vision. It's incredibly complex and well thought out and detailed. It's extraordinary in so many ways, I just wish I could have had a character or two that I could relate to emotionally.

For most people, Dune is a nearly incomprehensible cult classic movie that tells the tale of a man taking revenge for his father's murder by conquering a corrupt empire. For the true Sci-Fi nerd, Dune is to Science Fiction as Lord of the Rings was to Fantasy. At the time that Dune was published, Science Fiction was thought of as a low brow, childish genre that no one with an ounce of self respect would either read or write. Before this book, Sci-Fi was basically the joke of the literary world, and if you've read much Sci-Fi that comes before it, you'll see that people rightly thought of it as such. Frank Herbert had a brilliant idea. He had a story that was epic in scope, with great characters, intrigue, betrayal, revenge, and a whole slew of other things that had never really been applied to the Science Fiction genre, and instead of putting them in what would have been a more respectable setting at the time this book was written, he put it in a Sci-Fi setting. In a quote, Gene Roddenberry, creator of Star Trek, attributes his inspiration to go forward with his ideas for the original Star Trek series the following year to the success of Dune, and Sci-Fi fandom was born. Dune is an epic story, that happens to take place in a Science Fiction setting. At the time of its publication, it was one of a kind. These were two things that no one had ever thought to put together because the notion seemed ridiculous until Herbert showed them the way. You can see in the fifty years of Science Fiction that followed, many nods, references, and inspirations taken from this book.Herbert spent nearly a decade compiling notes before he even began writing this book. He wanted everything in it to be as scientifically accurate as possible. And it really does show in the book. In fact, when NASA began talking about how to terraform Mars into a planet that could support human life, it was Dune that they turned to first for ideas. Forgive any misspellings, this time through the book was in audio format and holy crap are there a lot of words hard to spell just by listening to them in this book.Dune begins with House Atreides packing up to leave their homeworld of Caladan to take possession of Arrakis, a.k.a. Dune, and the production of the spice that is harvested there, from their ancient rivals the Harkonens. Duke Leto knows that this is a trap, but is confidant that he can turn it to his advantage, and so has accepted the posting, moving his son Paul, and his concubine Jessica, as well as all of their servants and small army of House Soldiers to Dune.As Duke Leto predicted, a trap was laid for vague reasons that the book doesn't really feel the need to explain, though ARE explained, strangely enough, in the extended cut of the 1984 movie adaptation of all things. Through the use of a traitor, the Harkonens slaughter the Duke's forces, and take him and his family hostage. The Duke dies in custody, but Paul and his mother are able to escape into the desert where they join up with a group of Fremen, the native people of Arrakis.The rest of the book deals with Paul amongst the Fremen, preparing to take back Arrakis. He goes through rites of passage to become a full member of the Fremen tribe, and is affected by the spice to become the Kwisatz Haderach, or the first male Bene Gesserit, a being that their order has spent hundreds of generations regulating the breeding of the nobility of the universe to produce.When Paul's son is murdered, he leads a final attack on the Harkonens, taking Arrakis for the Fremen and the Empire for himself through the very real threat of being able to destroy all spice forever on Arrakis.The Good? As I said, Herbert did massive amounts of research into desert climates, what it would take to turn a desert into a paradise, how a body loses moisture and how that moisture can be saved, and a thousand other little details that make Dune all the more realistic because the science upon which the fiction is built is sound. His hard work really paid off to make a very realistic alien world. His combination of Science Fiction and elements of Epic, and Fantasy as well was revolutionary at the time, and brought about the golden age of Science Fiction that we know today. Such great series as Star Trek and Star Wars owe their success, in part, to Dune for paving the way before them. Herbert is a good writer, despite one or two flaws that I'll go into later in the review. His ability to describe things without seeming like he's describing them is something that few writers ever seem to be capable of achieving. His wording is, often times, very poetic, and he knows the value of repeating themes to make them stick in a reader's mind without going too far into repetition. Characters have very distinct and different personalities, and their interactions often come with quite a bit of clever dialog. There is a lot of exposition to give in this book, and the author never really infodumps it on us. He weaves it into the story oftentimes rather than lecturing us on it.The entire book is a rather clever allegory for Middle Eastern Oil that the author denied until shortly before his death. It makes a real profound statement on the world's reliance upon a resource that comes from such a volatile, and barren place that was MUCH ahead of its time.The Bad? There are a few things that are very vague in this book. The reason for moving House Atreides to Arrakis, for one. There are a lot of character motivations that are really left to the reader's imagination. We're not really told why a lot of things are happening, or how. There are a lot of things that happen for the convenience of the plot without explanation. Herbert worked for years on the science of Dune, but maybe he should have spent a little more time on developing the actual story on top of it. There are several uses of plot convenience and Dues Ex Machina that, while not overly offensive to the reader, DO still noticeably exist.The Ugly? The whole concept of the Kwisatz Haderach is not really explained AT ALL. Almost the entirety of the book deals with Paul becoming the Kwisatz Haderach, and Herbert never actually tells us what it is, what it does, or what it is supposed to accomplish. And yes, I HAVE read all of the other books so I have a much fuller understanding from them, but I'm talking about this book and this book alone, taken on its own merits. And taken on its own merits the Kwisatz Haderach is just some vague Chosen One that will do ""something"" sometime in the future. We are told that this being will be able to see the genetic memory of the male side of things as well as the female side, but it's never really explained what that means, what it entails, and why it's important. Paul develops powers of precognition, but we never really get told why or how, or if this is a part of his heritage as the Kwisatz Haderach. For a concept that is talked about for the majority of the book, and which the main character basically sets out on a quest to become, by the end of the book it's still a gigantic question mark. We know almost nothing about it by the time we reach the ending.This is just my personal preference, and really more of a nitpick than anything else, but the book is written in a voice called Third Person Omniscient, which means that rather than sticking with one single character's viewpoint for the entirety of a scene, with clear breaks to indicate the switching to a different character's point of view, the author switches around from character to character at random when one of them has a thought or observation that is relevant to the plot. I find it to be annoying and oftentimes confusing. This is one of my biggest dislikes in writing styles and was distracting enough to me that it did take away some of my enjoyment from the book.In conclusion, Dune has done quite a bit for Science Fiction as a genre. It's basically THE Science Fiction book. It's the one that paved the way for many of the excellent Sci-Fi that we have today, bringing the genre out of obscurity and showing its critics that it could be used to tell a truly epic story that is worth the time to read. Despite a few instances of vagueness, plot convenience, and just plain not explaining crucial plot details, Dune is a very enjoyable book that still holds up today, almost fifty years since its publication, as well as it did the day it was released. It is a book that every fan of Science Fiction should read at least once in their life. Check out my other reviews....more"

Frank Herbert didn't even have the shame to do that.The pacing, the characters, the overall plotline, the miraculous events that seem to happen at just the right time, the awful dialogue, and the Mary Sue that is Paul Atreides simply boggles the mind.I read this book because I thought there must be some redeeming quality somewhere at the end. Some glorious stroke of genius that somehow rescues the story from the fiery hell that is Frank H's staggeringly atrocious storytelling. But there wasn't.

However, my tastes have changed substantiallyA novel of political intrigue set in the distant future13 March 2011I read this book back during Year 12 and for an English assignment. I guess I wanted to find a book at that time that was science-fiction and that my English Teacher would accept (he was very, very particular with the books were were allow to review, and that involved books that he considered were not 'Airport Trash' or books that people did not read on the bus on the way to work). However, my tastes have changed substantially since then, and I am sure he would be very impressed with the books that I now read, though I would be tempted to read American Psycho and Wicked for my reviews if I were allowed to do year 12 English again (and sometimes I am tempted to do just that).Anyway, I write this commentary not based on the book but rather on the movie, as it is the movie that is more memorable than the book, though the movie is quite faithful to the book (with the exception the the heartplug, which was added to the film for a gross effect). The story is about Paul Artreides, the soul survivor of House Artreides after House Harkonan invades the Planet Arakis (or Dune). The setting is in a galactic empire where these two houses are at war (and have been for a very long time) over control of Arakis which is the only planet that produces the spice melange, the key to interstellar travel. The emperor fears the popularity of House Artreides, but he is unable to launch a direct attack upon them, so he creates a plot to destroy them by sending then to Arakis and then equipping the Harkonan with his own troops to attack and destroy the Artreides. After the attack, Paul and his loyal followers are thrown into the desert to die.However, unbenowest to the emperor, Paul is actually the end result of a breeding program by the Bene Geusserit to produce a superhuman known as the Kwisacz Haderach (it is interesting how much of the background of the book is lost in translation). Further, he does not die in the desert but is rescued by the nomadic Fremen, the inhabitants of Arakis, and then begins to build himself an army to seek revenge for the murder of his father. Also we learn the secret of the spice in that it is the monstrous sandworms that produce the spice, and thus he who controls the sandworms, controls the spice (and Paul does end up controlling the Sandworms).I am not entirely sure if there is any overarching themes in this book, but it is full of intrigue and in itself is an epic. The book spawned itself a further series (of which I have not read, and it has been suggested that the further books are nowhere near as good, but it appears that they are immensely popular). Further, the book ends with Paul marrying the emperor's daughter, not because he loves her, but because by doing so he prevents the emperor from having an heir. Yes, I should also remember to mention that in this world, computers have been banned (due to some very bad thing that happened a long time ago) and as such technology is all human based, with computing performed by the Mentats and technology advancing by genetic breeding. There are a lot of groups in this story that are all vying for control, though one can still ask whether the Artreides are really as good as they are made out to be, or whether they, like to others, are simply attempting to manoeuvre themselves into the best position possible. Further, the movie portrays a horrid and ugly Harkonen, but this is not the case in this book and as it turns out, they are merely the puppets of a dubious emperor.I have now seen two different movies (for want of a better word since one is more of a mini-series) and read the book so I am somewhat familiar with the story. The thing about Dune is that it is very political and the book is more political intrigue as opposed to hard science-fiction. I almost suspect, as was the case with many science-fiction writers in this era, that science-fiction was more of a vehicle for social commentary than it is these days. These days science-fiction seems to be more about special effects (particularly if it is on television) and action.The interesting thing that I noticed with Dune was the concept of the desert world from which the only substance that allows interstellar travel, the spice milange, is available, meaning that he who controls Arakis controls the empire. While it may not have been the case back in 1965, because this was prior to OPEC flexing their muscles, it is interesting to consider the relationship between Frank Herbert's Dune and the modern Middle East. This is more so today since wars have been fought over the control of the region's oil reserves. Even so, in the eighties, the Middle East was in effect the battle ground between the two superpowers.I suspect that the analogy can break down though because while it appears that the Harkonans represent the Russians and the Artreides represent the Americans (and the Fremin representing the Arabs), America never found itself isolated. In fact it ended up defeating Russia, though this may not have been as evident then as it is now. A part of me feels that the Emperor represents the UN, and there is a lot of fear within the United States that the UN has plans to undermine US sovereignty and are allying with their enemies to that particular purposes. In a way it also seems as if the other factions in Dune (the Bene Gesserit, who represent the Church, particularly since the messiah comes out of the Bene Gesserit; the Mentats, who represent the scientific community; and the Spacers Guild, who represent the corporate world â the thing with these factions is that they owe no allegiance except to themselves, and while they may not be a sovereign house, they have considerable influence over the great houses of the empire) are also conspiring to bring about the downfall of the Artriedes, and I suspect this reflects probably not just the extreme right in the United States, but also the author's fears as well. However, for me at least (without doing huge amounts of research) it is difficult to see if this was the case with the United States during this period, though we must remember that the 60s was a pretty turbulent time in American history, where you have the baby boomers pretty much deserting the church and seeking a culture of free love and unrest in relation to the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War....more

Perhaps I was doomed to dislike this book when I started at page one and discovered that its two main characters were named Paul and Jessica. Still, I moved past that; I'd heard this book was good, I was going to persevere. Then on page 20 or so Paul was obnoxious and sexist and I got frustrated. And then, it has to be said, Paul never really did anything to redeem himself for being generally obnoxious. Mostly he just oscillated between continuing to be obnoxious and being some all-seeing, all-knowing dispenser of wisdom and neither of those personas was particularly endearing.Honestly, I was annoyed for a lot of the book that Paul had all of these special mental abilities that supposedly had never been had by men before, only women, and Paul was such an arrogant twerp anyway that I strongly disliked him being some kind of Chosen One. I felt that Frank Herbert was going to have this rule that only women can have these powers, the character of Paul should have been a woman then. But then it seems that the entire point of the plot is that he IS the first man to have this abilities - the Kwisatz Haderach or however it's supposed to be spelt - so then I guess it just annoyed me that there was this deep gender essentialism in something that should not have anything to do with gender at all (the innate abilities of the brain...).Aside from that! This book also had approximately 9658976897579668 male characters who I couldn't tell the difference between. Towards the end there some guy named Guernsey or something turned up and supposedly he was Paul's friend from way back but I had no clue who he was and nor was I entirely sure I was supposed to. The female characters who existed seemed mostly interested in basking in the glory of Paul (probably he had a halo or something too, idk). Chani was nothing more than his love interest. That woman he won (as property) by killing Jamis was the same. Alia barely even did anything. Jessica was by far the most developed of the female characters, but even she was really disappointing because literally everyone spent the entire book talking about what a threat she posed to Paul and like, no, she didn't in any way whatsoever. PAUL HIMSELF at one point identified Jessica as his ""true enemy"" and well, I guess he's not all-seeing and all-knowing after all because that was LITERALLY NEVER FOLLOWED UP ON. All she did was disapprove of his relationship with Chani because she's an utter snob and disapproved of him seeing a ""desert girl"". Wow. I'm shaking in my boots, Jessica.There are some defences to be made of this book - for instance, Herbert was obviously not trying to write about anything other than a deeply sexist society, so the fact that women get treated as property and evaluated in terms of their marriageability is not a flaw of the writer so much as the deeply annoying society he invented. Nonetheless, there were not enough female characters and those characters that did exist were not strong enough to counteract this. But then again, the male characters weren't very strong either, hence why I mixed them all up, so... really...Anyway, I was dithering about whether to give this book two stars or three (mostly because I'd heard it was so good and I thought I'd judged it unfairly just because of the names-of-the-characters thing making me hostile from the off). BUT THEN I READ THE LAST PAGE.NO JOKE, the last page is about how Paul has to marry this Princess Irulan to secure peace across the kingdoms or something but NO WORRIES because he's going to treat Princess Irulan like a worthless piece of shit forever because his true love is Chani! And Jessica is really pleased about this because she no longer hates Chani and she apparently thinks Princess Irulan deserves to live a life of misery because, y'know, she dared to be born a woman into a family that would force her into an arranged marriage and that is definitely all her fault.Seriously, I hate you Jessica.And basically everyone in this book, really. I guess Chani was okay, if not very well developed. Also the woman Paul won off Jamis, she was sassy, except I forgot her name so I guess not that sassy.In conclusion...This book is hyped beyond all proportion. I didn't understand it and it annoyed me but if you like long books with irritating and indistinguishable characters, go for your life.(EDIT: I decided to demote this book from two stars to one star, because I actually really hated it so two stars was bizarrely generous. I don't remember anything I liked about this book. Don't read it.)...more"

I know, I know, it's a classic and I'm meant to love it, and I'm an utter disappointment to my parents, who dearly love the early Dune books. Oh well, such is life, no? I can see why Dune is so popular, but, largely, it's just not the sort of book I can love, though I'm very glad to have read it, so thank you to Robbie for getting me to do so!Time and again, I've said that I am a character reader, and I'm sure I'll set many more times. Dune has many charms, but they are not of characterization. Most of the cast is just so focused on one thing at all times, on ruling or backstabbing or mothering or being a wife or whatever. They're largely not people of interests outside of what they need to survive. Everything is about the world building and the political landscape. This isn't a book of banter and bonding. If world building delights you even without strong characterization, by all means, come explore these sand dunes.At times, though, Dune did flirt with being a book I could like overall. The story of Paul Atreides doing a sort of Monte Cristo and rising up for vengeance with a whole bunch of power at his back is pretty awesome. The powers exhibited by Paul and the Bene Gesserit, women trained to have crazy fighting skills and more, are fascinating. I'm also curious about Arrakis and how this planet exists. How can a planet with so little water sustain life (by drinking their bodily fluids and those of others for one thing O_O)? What precisely is the spice and how does it relate to the worms?These elements that I liked, though, were bogged down in the political back and forth, the perspective hopping between those of the Atreides group and the antagonists. I just had no fucks to give about what the Harkonnens or the Emperor were doing. Paul so obviously has all the power in the world and has been fulfilling all of these prophecies to be the Kwisatz Haderach, whatever that really means, so it's not like he's going to be defeated. It's sort of like how Harry Potter obviously wasn't going to die in Rowling's series. It's hard to care about Paul when I know he won't be killed.Oh, though I'm not generally a big fan of characters being that powerful and perfect, I do like the way Herbert showed the difficulties of being Paul. He clearly struggles with the apartness of being so much more than everyone around him. The fact that he receives reverence rather than friendship further alienates him from the rest of humanity. This in turn makes it more likely that he will turn corrupt or unfeeling, as was oft hinted.What really held me back in Dune more than anything else was the writing. It's not a style I found pleasing. Herbert uses a close third person, which jumps about from character to character. On top of that, character's thoughts are in italics. For the most part, that's alright, but sometimes there were long paragraphs of fragmented thoughts separated by ellipses. Between each chapter, unmarked stretches of time pass, leaving me constantly disoriented when I pick the book back up. Little details are dealt with endlessly but the climax skips most of the fighting for more talking. So many people die in Dune, and yet there's so little actual action.Also worthy of note is that the treatment of women in the novel made me uncomfortable, as well as the treatment of the Fremen. Women can obviously be quite strong, stronger than the men, as the Bene Gesserit show. However, that's not a feminist move if these powerful women are essentially slaved, sold out as concubines to wealthy men. Plus, there's a weird message that being a concubine is actually better than a wife that I find really puzzling.The Fremen are the desert people of Arrakis, who know much better how to survive there, and rule the planet no matter what Duke claims to be the leader. They're way better fighters than anyone else, and they do get respect for that. Still, I find the fact that they need Paul, from outside their culture, to come in and rule them disgusting. It's like this is pro-colonization, and I am not a fan.That all came out quite ranty, but I really don't think Dune is a terrible book. It's not a great book for me, since I'm not all that interested in political intrigue or world building for its own sake. Dune's also very much a product of it's time. Glad to have read it so I know what the fuss is about, but I shan't be continuing on, which is probably for the best since I heard the series goes bad places....more

Because gosh, the worldbuilding. I'm marking this as ""non-western setting"" even though it's a completely fictional world, purely because Herbert's entire universe is so deliciously influenced by other non-Western cultures and spiritual systems, and the Fremen are essentially Arabic Bedouins, Navajo, and Jewish nomads mixed up all in one, and they kick all kinds of ass. From Brian Herbert's afterword:Among other things, the Dune universe is a spiritual melting pot, a far future in which religious beliefs have combined into interesting forms. Discerning readers will recognize Buddhism, Sufi Mysticism, and other Islamic belief systems, Catholicism, Protestantism, Judaism, and Hinduism.I even devoured the lengthy appendices, because I am just so in love with this universe -- it takes some interesting material indeed for me to read, essentially, a dictionary cover-to-cover.As for the book itself: it's a classic and I'm now seeing/re-appreciating why, although it's much less sci-fi than one might expect, anchored far more in Shakespearean royalty coups, classical myth, fantasy 'Chosen One' tropes, and mysticism bordering on magic, especially considering the world of Dune is one where computers have been long-forbidden, thanks to what sounds like a failed A.I. uprising. (And can I just say that I love this, the way Herbert casually drops hints towards a deep history and significant past events but without beating you over the head with exposition? It leaves you with these tantalising glimpses and a craving to fill in the blanks. I also have a lot of A.I. feels generally -- COUGH MASS EFFECT GETH/QUARIANS COUGH)Everything is strangely organic, even down to computers having been replaced by ""human computers"" called Mentats. All of the worldbuilding details just feel grounded & accounted for & realistic, even as prophets see into the far-flung future and giant sandworms swallow factory crawlers.It's a world in which body language gives you away; complete mastery over reading other people's tics and twitches is one of your most potent weapons; words are power (the Bene Gesserit's wielding of the Voice also reminded me a bit of Max Barry's Lexicon); where political schemes incubate for literally hundreds of years before coming to fruition (seriously though, guys, the Bene Gesserit!). And the Fremen are just the coolest. The. Coolest.The middle part of the novel (Book II: Muad'Dib) dragged a lot for me, though, since Paul's 'awakening' and superpowers aren't very interesting to read about -- I was much more interested in what came before and after, and the blank spaces on the map. I mentioned this in comments, but the Baron Harkonnen is just such a moustache-twirling caricature of a villain, too; he serves his purpose, however, but I found his nephews (both of them!) and the Emperor more interesting as ambiguous figures. Lady Jessica is fantastic as a strong female character, and I'm happy to see such a powerful, loving mother/son relationship on the page.And it all leads to a crazy, wild, awesome climax -- but also with a far-sighted hint towards the future and things unseen, imparted through epistolary epigraphs and quotes from fictional textbooks, the historical analysis of the tumultuous events unfolding on the page. It makes me super stoked to read more books in the series, which I'm absolutely going to do (maybe this will be my big series conquest of 2015?).And apropos of nothing, let's all go admire Emily Carroll's Dune fanart....more"

So to start 2016, I read the source material which was published in 1965 and boy, I was marvelled.The plot is very hard to summarise so I shall try my best. In the far distant future, House Atreides has been sent to govern Arrakis AKA Dune, a brutal desert planet with little water, but in a spice that can give everlasting life. Meanwhile, House Harkonnen has planted a traitor within the Atreides court and plan their attack, in order to restore the wealth to their own house. At the centre of this story about these houses which are on the brink of war, the chief protagonist is Duke Leto Atreidesâs fifteen-year old son Paul who is coming of age as he is initially set to be the heir to his beloved fatherâs noble house but ultimately a prophecy that will lead him into greater power.Now when you hear the story of a young boy being prophesied at a time of war whilst living in a desert planet, you immediately think of Star Wars, which itself took cues from earlier science-fiction i.e. Flash Gordon. Despite thematic similarities, the two universes provide their own voice and in the case of Herbertâs novel, it is a more complex tale of politics, religion and human emotion.Told in a third-person narrative, we explore the distinct noble families through its leaders and how their actions as leaders can result in both the good and bad intentions. Perhaps the most interesting character is Duke Leto Atreides who loves his son and his Bene Gesserit concubine Jessica, and despite his best intentions as a well-respected head, the power he is given can allow him to give orders that can distance those closest to him. To quote Jor-El from 1978âs Superman: âThe father becomes the sonâ¦â as Paul has to follow his own destiny and starts to feel conflicted when he is given power and the challenges he makes as a leader.Considering that many of the characters are classic sci-fi archetypes, it is credit to Herbertâs writing that he gives them a three-dimensional relatability, even living in the outlandish environments. Along with the use of inner monologues, the story delves into a number of different family dynamics from the love between the Atreides to the evil deception of the Harkonnens.Amidst the noble houses and the different cultures inhabiting Arrakis, there are many discussions about ecology and religion, which leads to perhaps the bookâs greatest triumph: world-building. Like J.R.R. Tolkien, Frank Herbert presents this futuristic universe with such detail, in terms of exploring the geography and ecology of Dune, as well as heavily describing the distinctions between the various houses and cultures. The appendices at the end of the book is certainly worth a read as Herbert writes them as pieces of history.Unlike The Lord of the Rings, Dune is never bogged down by its world-building and whilst its multi-layered narrative can be heavy, it is a compelling space opera that is centrally about a young man rising from adolescence and becoming a hero....more

(I first read Dune when I was 12 or so.) For example, I had never really grasped the ""ecological"" theme of the novel that many critics point to. I understood the setting of Arrakis but it was just that - the scene where much of the action takes place. The CD brought out Arrakis' role as a character in the book that my readings hadn't. Which is good - I like discovering something new when I reread a book.On the downside: The discs keep going back and forth between the narrator who reads all parts - dialog and narrative - and a cast that handles the dialog. And there appears to be no rhyme or reason for when this happens. In the first case, the narrator is fine when he's reading the story but his vocal range is limited. I wouldn't have minded him reading the entire novel but I think the production should have been consistent - all reader or reader + cast.As to the cast-read parts, most of the speakers are seriously miscast in my opinion. Particularly egregious were the actors who voiced Gurney Halleck and Stilgar. Gurney's tone and rhythms are all off; and Stilgar's delivery is stilted and suffers from a bad pseudo-Middle Eastern accent. (I admit, however, that the fault may not be entirely the cast's fault. Listening to Dune does highlight the fact that Herbert's ear for natural-sounding dialog is not always very good.)Recommended if you liked Dune and need something to listen to on a long road trip or to-and-from work, but one could wish for a better adaptation....more"

It's a more complex and critical message than most people realize, and many may not even recognize it at all. What's more, it asks them to call their own character into question. That is a sometimes difficult thing for readers to do.Of his Dune series Herbert wrote, ""I am showing you the superhero syndrome and your own participation in it.""He also said, ""Dune was aimed at this whole idea of the infallible leader because my view of history says that mistakes made by a leader (or made in a leader's name) are amplified by the numbers who follow without question.""And just to make things perfectly clear, he said: ""The bottom line of the Dune trilogy is: beware of heroes. Much better [to] rely on your own judgment, and your own mistakes.""As to why he would write a book with such a theme, here's a fourth (and the last I'll give you, I promise) quote: ""The function of science fiction is not always to predict the future, but sometimes to prevent it.""I've read this book five, six, maybe seven times now over the course of thirty to forty years (geez, I'm old....) I'll be damned if it doesn't still hold up. There are bits here and there that could be described as dated prose, but I think they are really more narrative and dialogue choices that differentiated Herbert from the crowd when the book was written, not the product of a particular decade. The plot, the characters, the ideas remain relevant and topical. The desert/Arabic/Persian references of the book are as poignant today as they were when the book was written--and may well be into the future given the seemingly endless ""volatility"" of that part of the world.As an older and arguably more mature reader I find myself wondering about the science of ""spice"" and how that might work. How might the chemistry of an alien biological by-product interact with the space/time continuum by altering consciousness? It seems much more likely that such a substance would pass through a person relatively inertly or kill them, but the idea of biochemistry interacting with the mind that way? It still holds up as an idea, if a somewhat ""soft sci-fi"" one. Really it's not all that much more scientific than ""hyperspace"" or ""warp speed"" or ""The Force"" but it does add a level of verisimilitude simply because of its strangeness.The feudalism and system of nobility of the society that Herbert designed are rather overwrought tropes these days, though his take on the concept is different enough from that of other SF/fantasy writers that I don't think it is really an issue.The idea of a vast, inter-stellar breeding program to create a super-being has elements of the macabre and mundane real world breeding programs to it. That element of the story should make the careful reader uncomfortable. However, that feature of the ""chosen one"" story is vital to the underlying message that Herbert was trying to convey. The concept of ""breeding"" is at the core of humanity's fatalism. It's at the heart of real world racial purity programs, Nietzschean apologists, social Darwinism, and the perils that--if such ideas were actually meaningful--such a being would represent for ""mere mortals."" Thematically, Herbert was saying that his lead characters are, in fact, the villains. His story is that the urge of humanity to follow a charismatic, messianic leader is both destructive (to humanity) and self-destructive (of the individual.) That fundamental human servility is used by those in power to manipulate their fellows into not only killing each other, but actually denying their own human worth.Among the things that should be comprehended by humanity, that's got to be up there in the top 10 ideas. It's somewhere between natural selection and ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you"" for civilizing concepts. However, it's a difficult thing for most people to grasp by its very nature. Many people are, essentially, followers and they don't want their nature revealed to them even surreptitiously in their entertainment. By tapping into that basic human desire to be lead, he creates characters that readers invest in emotionally, and the underlying theme--that those characters are really villains--is hard for people to accept. It goes against that basic human drive to worship a ""hero"" in some form or another. It contradicts our sense of family, calls into question our moral system, and undermines the basis of most societies. It does so with the highest of aims in mind, and asks people to reflect upon an aspect of their character that is, perhaps, an aspect of the suicidal impulse of humankind. That's heady stuff, and well worth considering. If an unexamined life is not worth living then an unexamined society is not worth living in and Herbert asks us to examine that aspect of our collective efforts--that need to admire, follow, worship, sublimate the self to the will of another, fight, kill and sacrifice oneself for a supposedly higher cause. Is that worth it if the cause is another person? Is it worth it if that cause is an idea? Is it worth it at all?This are big questions and Herbert puts them to us covertly but in broad strokes. It's not just an extraordinary crafted message, but a vitally important one....more"

Even without its innumerable critical acclaims, the novel is counted amongst all circles as an irreplaceable cornerstone of modern speculative fiction. In fact, with its five sequels, three prequels, two spinoff series (and one more in development), two companion books, and numerous adaptations for media both static and interactive, Dune seems to be less a book in and of itself, and more akin to the desert spring at the heart of an oasis, a wellspring of creative energy upon which dozens of children feed. However, it is another aspect of Dune that is to serve as the basis upon which this review shall grow to fruition. The widespread influence and propagation of the concepts in Dune were made possible by the inclusion of hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of cultural, historical, political, spiritual, and scientific details, scattered throughout the work and supporting its storyline. Dune itself acts far less as a novel than as a massive encyclopedia entry, a well-crafted chronicle of Herbert's imagined world and its myriad facets well-masked by a beautifully crafted, but ultimately ancillary, story. The narrative of Dune is marvelous, rivaling that of many a better-critiqued author's magnum opus, and the characters, plot, and language are undeniably crafted as well as almost any other novel. However, the setting, in all its splendiferous nature and abyssal depth, is the main focus of the novel, the sole axis upon which the story-wheel turns its ponderous revolution. The main character, Paul, and his mother, Jessica, are an illicit trainee and a legitimate student, respectively, of the Bene Gesserit, an ""ancient school of mental and physical training established primarily for female students"" (Herbert 10/x), whose interests extend into the realms of political manipulation of the various Noble Houses composing the Imperium, religious engineering, and the use of precise bloodline manipulation to create the Kwisatz Haderach, ""a male Bene Gesserit whose organic mental powers will bridge space and time"" (Herbert 18/xviii). This sisterhood's existence stems from upon the outlawing of thinking machines and humanoid robots by the Butlerian Jihad, a pan-galactic religious movement which also produced the Mentat, a ""class of Imperial citizens trained for supreme accomplishments of logic"" (Herbert 20/xx); amongst the Mentat is counted Thurfir Hawat, under whom Paul (who may well be the Kwisatz Haderach) trains in addition to his mother and Duncan Idaho, a swordsman who teaches him to use the kindjal, a weapon bearing similarities to the crysknife, which is wielded by the Fremen, descendants of the Zensunni Wanderers and natives of the planet Dune... and so it goes. Every event, every personage, every act, even the most minor aspect imaginable, is a window into the vast backstory of the universe concocted in the alchemical labs of the author's imagination. Even the writing style is possessed of many qualities of historically referential literature: it is succinct and dry without a hint of dullness; it utilizes a very particular form of figurative language that, while very evocative, is terse and short in presentation; and it depicts concurrent events, both physical and psychological (and there are many psychological events), with equivalent form and verve as it describes acts long since passed. In addition, the novel takes pleasure in self-referential historicalness, beginning each chapter, as it does, with an excerpt from any one of numerous fictitious book, which are themselves analytical delineations on the very events and characters featured in the novel itself. With this simple device, Herbert lends still more credibility, not merely to the legendary status of the story itself, but to the profundity of the world in which said occurrences take place. In short, it is pure folly to so much as attempt to make the case that Herbert put little thought into either the novel's gloriously crafted storyline or its expansive universe. Each is as important as the other in the context of his novel, in contrast to many others that end up striking a horrifically uneven balance between setting and narrative. Dune has most certainly earned its place in science fiction history, for innumerable reasons in addition to its meshing of place and events, and it comes highly recommended to any who dare test the waters of such an enthralling limpid pool of refreshing novelty, a novelty still very much applicable over 40 years after its publication....more"

A lot of it also utterly and completely deserves 5 stars. The detail that has gone into the background of the story, the complexity of every system in it - it all feels ancient. You donât feel youâre reading fiction at all, you feel as if youâre reading an account of actual events, an actual universe. Itâs that detailed and wholesome. Nothing is glossed over, and nothing is a coincidence. Itâs also impressive in the themes it takes on. Its commentary is broad from politics, religion, environment, ecology, culture etc. There are colorful and multidimensional characters (well, to some extent), and it gives us plenty of different point of views, to ensure we understand each perspective, to make certain we donât get stuck on one truth over another. In so many ways I am totally for with this novel, and I canât deny that it is a product of monumental effort and extreme dedication, care and vision. So why only 3.5 stars?Because while the world building is immaculate and the historical background that is given to everything is bulletproof, the actual plot of the novel didnât strike me as particularly good. If you look at it simply, you can describe it as a story about betrayal, power, greed and destiny, which is all good and interesting stuff. But when you make you main character into the fucking messiah (and donât ever let there be any question of whether or not he really is, you know that from the very first page, basically) and give him the power to look into the future, you take away the agency and the personality of your best characters. They didnât seem to me as individual people with free will, they became vessels for a larger cause, simply there to carry the story forward, to serve Paul in his weird, involuntary crusade, and get star-struck by his power.Half the time Paulâs powers were useless anyway, and the one course he swore heâd never take is the one he inevitably has to take in the end, making you think that not even he has any power over his life or his actions. Itâs a puppet show, an interesting puppet show, to be sure, but youâre aware that someoneâs pulling those strings (hello, author). Itâs not so much a story in its own right, anymore, itâs a story that exists, not to tell a story, but to explore ideas. Paulâs story is not a story about Paul, itâs about religion, about the danger of blind belief and conviction, about a people finding their messiah and the inevitable waves of destruction it has to cause. Paulâs there because we need a figurehead to explore this idea through. Do you understand it when I say the characters are vessels? They have little personality and very little agency, theyâre the excuse Herbert needed to write this story. Itâs not a book about people, itâs a book about ideas. I donât know if that made any sense. A more tangible reason I didnât like the plot is that a few things just didnât make sense to me: (under a spoiler, because it really IS a spoiler) (view spoiler)[1.Paul has a son. We never meet this son. Then the son dies. Why was the son there?2.Paul drinks poison, then he goes into a coma for three weeks, wakes up and because he learned to transform the poison so itâs not dangerous and therefore didnât kill him. Then he asks his mother to go transform some of said poison. Why donât you do it yourself? Too tired? Or what? 3.In the end, when Paul has lured the Emperor to Arrakis, the Emperor has a chat with Baron Harkonnen, who tells him his Mentat Hawat has been missing for 5 days. A short while later, Paul calls for the Emperor to surrender or whatever - and whoâs in his entourage as well? Hawat. Where did he come from? What just happened? Wasnât he missing? 4.What did Jessica make her servant (I forget her name) tell the Fremen was 'wrong' with Alia? I never caught that, but it apparently fixed everything. 5.Shouldn't Paul or, I don't know, Alia's mother be a tiny bit more worried she's out there just slashing throats? I don't care how ancient a soul she has, not worrying is just a little too cold, especially when your son/grandson just died.  (hide spoiler)]Was I just really bad at reading this book? Itâs very possible.Iâm in two minds about it. If you read it from an entirely philosophical and political perspective itâs amazing and, yes, impressive, but if you look at it from a story-telling perspective it falls a little short. Still, Iâd recommend it, though not because itâs a fun book, but because itâs an interesting book. ...more

But it's deeply flawed.Sociologically & theologically, it's impossible to believe that the racial/religious groupings Herbert posits could ever exist. Zensunnis? Orange-Catholics? Some future religion based on a synthesis of Islam and Buddhism, or a future Christianity combining all previous sects is possible. What I can't accept is that there'd EVER be an ""Orange Catholic""âit's like spitting in the eye of both sides of a centuries-long war (beginning at least in 1641 with the Irish Confederate Wars, and not done yet). Both Christianity and Islam sprang from Judaism, but neither call themselves some variety of Jew. BahÃ¡'Ã­ developed from Islam, but they don't call themselves Muslims. Words have power, and I think this is a rather ham-fisted attempt to coerce those words into a form they'd never take.The planet Arrakis (Dune) exists as it does, it's believed, because the Navigator's Guild won't permit weather control satellites above it. Just how are we supposed to believe the Guild controls what people do in near-space? Absolutely they control inter-stellar travel, but every player in this epic controls cruiser-sized spaceships. If they couldn't control the weather to make the planet wetter, they could just go out to the cometary cloud and bring in a few billion tonnes of ice. If the Guild could prevent that, why would anybody but the Guild have spaceships?The Bene Gesserit are wilfully blind (though that, at least, is a pretty typical human failing!). The Suk physicians are intensely proud of an unbreakable conditioning that actually seems to be pretty easy to break (and must have been broken before...). And the computer-like Mentats don't seem to be able to see what's in front of their faces.So, after about a half-dozen reads, I've decided that reading it any more will probably only make me like it less.

While Lucas took much inspiration from Dune and adapted those concepts into a space-fantasy adventure that's fun for the whole family (hey, not a slam; like I said, I'm a fan), Herbert's imaginary sci-fi universe is much more difficult waters (sands?) to tread. Heavy on courtly intrigues, Machiavellian space-machinations, trade negotiations, double-crosses and triple-crosses between the various royal houses (the ""good"" Atreides vs. the ""bad"" Harkonnens and the Emperor)âyou know, the kind of stuff that made the Star Wars ""prequels"" suckâHerbert makes it all work through a persistence of vision that binds all the pieces together into a coherent whole that reads like a film. Herbert is much less of a moralist than Lucas; not at all, actually. The ""villains"" are treacherous, self-serving, brutal, venal. The ""heroes"" are brave, loyal, forthright, and often Machiavellian, manipulative, and brutal in their own right. If you like warm fuzzies from your protagonists, you're not going to get it here, sorry. After closing the book, I felt that I had extracted four stars' worth of entertainment value from it, even though Herbert had put five stars' worth of wonderment and imagination into it. The failure to get more out of it is my own. Hours after finishing it, I still find myself dwelling on the richness of it. I still haven't decided whether the ""savior"" is just another despot; I'll have to mull it over some more.

Thufir managed to such subtle manipulations, but never learned the truth until the end?  (hide spoiler)] There were others. None huge, but a bit rougher than I recalled. It probably comes from knowing the story too well & being so immersed in it.Anyway, if this is a first or second read, I highly recommend this format. This book has endured very well over 50 years & is still a true classic.Note: I list this as part of a series. While I have friends with similar reading tastes who believe so, I don't. IMO, this is a stand alone classic of SF & should be read that way. The next book, Dune Messiah, is a joke - like a comic book sequel to Moby-Dick; or, The Whale. Children of Dune is better, but depressing in the turns it takes. God Emperor of Dune which is impenetrable, philosophical bullshit. I never bothered with any after that, but the series has turned into a sprawling universe of sequels & series, many written by Herbert's son.

The movies are good too, though if I could find a way to cross-breed Lynch's version with the version done on the Sci-Fi channel, I think we might actually be able to come to something that really looks like what Herbert wrote. Unfortunately the novel is so dense and so complex that any attempt to put it on-screen is going to fall short.For the two or three of you who don't know the story, know this: it is the year 10,191. The universe is ruled by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, my fath - DAMN YOU DAVID LYNCH!Sorry, got caught up there for a moment. The Universe is ruled by an Emperor, and governed by planetary noble houses. For those with the resources to do so, travel within the empire is instantaneous, from one corner of the universe to the other. The Spacing Guild, with their space-bending Navigators, hold society together. What gives the Navigators their power is the Spice, and that can only be found on Arrakis. On Dune.House Harkonnen, a bloodline of deception, pain and malice, has been removed from Arrakis, replaced by the good and noble House Atreides. Duke Leto the Just is set over the planet, and would probably rule with kindness and generosity. But kindness and generosity don't make money, and there are plans within plans within plans, all of which are bent on destroying the Atreides. But what the Emperor and his servants cannot know is the role that the Duke's son, Paul, will play in re-shaping the entire order of the universe.There.

I think that Frank Herbert is deserving of being considered as one of the foundation blocks of modern Science Fiction. To me, what made this novel so special is the immense amount of care that Herbert put in to world-building and creating comprehensive political and religious structures that encompass many different facets of the people who populate the complex world (and universe) that he has created.In some ways, Herbert has almost treated this novel as more of a Fantasy-type novel that he then fleshed out with Science Fiction elements. So much care has gone into creating the world itself that you don't see as much in Science Fiction as you do in Fantasy. While reading the novel, I felt that you could have asked Mr. Herbert any off-the-wall question about the Freman culture or way of life and he would be able to answer without hesitation. I think this same feel also applies to the Bene Gesserit, House Atreides, House Harkonnen and the politics and people involved in the majority of the Imperial regime. It's this feel of a complete back-ground and established history that make this novel (and hopefully the rest of the series) truly special much like Tolkien's Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.The story itself is fairly fast-paced and filled with political intrigue. The story does have slow moments from time to time, but these times mainly focus on critical moments in character development or the building of important plot points, so they didn't seem to drag at all but actually served to enhance the more dramatic and action-oriented segments of the novel. Characters both good and evil, long-term and brief, are fully fleshed out and easy to root for or against. All in all, a very good novel and one that is deserving of the praise that it has received from fans and critics alike. I will not hesitate to pick up the next book in the series sometime down the road....more

I don't like the rapid jumps of point of view. I also think the ""insights"" provided by the jump into a character's thoughts are quite obvious and a poor strategy for alerting the reader of character motivations. It's actually kind of bad writing. But it gets better as the book progresses and more happens within each chapter to one or two characters only. I'm at Part II and the writing has improved tremendously.I do think it's funny how little bits of ""I'm writing in 1965"" slip into what is a remarkably timeless story. One character consults a wrist watch, and it's called a wrist watch. They watch instructional films. There's an evil homosexual in power, which is supposed to be a radical idea the way it's presented. I am very impressed, however, with the way the powerful Bene Gessirit (sp?) women are presented as just being powerful without any of the ""I Am Woman"" overtones that appear in 1970s and 1980s post-ERA fiction. Perhaps it matters that a man is writing and lacks the outrage and indignation of the oppressed and does not exaggerate what women could accomplish if given the chance. He just presents them as a sect with influence everywhere that pass knowledge and information through female bloodlines. They are neither earth goddessy nor particularly nurturing nor acting exactly like men. It's very modern and quite prescient. I'm impressed.ADDED FEBRUARY 28:I dunno. The book petered out for me in part three. Maybe I'm just being harsh on books this month, but I couldn't keep track of it anymore. Nothing happened but you had to just keep reading. I think I got sick of all the telepathy and prescience. The paranormal is fine but everything was explained as known in some psychic way. No one ever did anything except look into future timelines and pick the one where you weren't dead or someone else was dead and then stuff happened with that result. It was like eating dinner from a pill in Willy Wonka. There'd be these comments from a character along the lines of ""let's go kill all those hundreds of slaves now"" and ""we just killed six thousand people outside""--huge events mentioned in passing. If you have to mention something like that at all, shouldn't there be a scene detailing it? That's excitement, not wisdom gained by psychically uploading the wisdom of ten people older than you.I remember really liking this book the first time I read it and now I don't remember why. Maybe it's because of all the jihad and bourkas and desert nomads in the book. I think we're Islamed out lately. I really would rather have started with the part where the Fremen were doing real work to transform the planet, but I already got that in Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars Trilogy (interestingly, another book/s with direct tributes to Islam).I guess in the end I don't care that much about courtly intrigue and want the book to be about something else.

This time I decided to stick with it no matter what.For anyone struggling with the beginning: it gets easier.Now for my review. Let me start with the bad things. This book is dated. The dialogue is painful in places. Herbert loves to have characters think the obvious, marked with italics, to make sure the reader doesn't miss anything important. There's a lot of 'telling' and I had the impression 'showing' wasn't Herbert's strength.But apart from that? Amazing world-building. The planet, the dunes, the worms. Paul's journey. His mother's journey. The mythology. Politics and intrigues. It's a wonderful world, and I'm actually excited to read the sequels (at least the ones written by Frank Herbert himself.)...more

337991236	234225	2012-05-28	4	Fascinating read. The world-building in this novel by the far the best that I've read. I feel like I know all about it - the religion, beliefs, costumes and technologies. Somehow it's all in my mind despite there being no lengthy passages of a narrator explaining these things to you as an outsider. The story was intriguing and operatic in scale but didn't grip me as much as I expected. Despite that, this book is immense and deserves its reputation as a great classic of science fiction.

My first reading of Dune took about twenty-years; the reread took about a month. Go me!Since my first reading, I've watched Jodorowsky's Dune a few times, the David Lynch Dune maybe a half a time (it always sort of mashes into a blur every time I attempt it), learned a lot about the universally-worshiped Avalon Hill Dune board game, and in general thought a lot about Dune and its legacy. None of my thoughts here are new -- mostly just synthesizing what's been stated and restated about all the interpretations of this story, up to and including the unfinished original series. The main takeaway of Dune is that it's a book worth more than the sum of its parts, specifically in its impact on the entirety of Western culture. One could argue rather easily that we are a culture whose myths rely on fantasy and science fiction, and that more than a pop cultural backdrop, these myths have served to paint a deeply-ingrained portrait of how we understand ourselves. The fact that we are also the largest exporter of pop culture in the modern world means that our myths have, to a certain extent, infected the myths of the international community as a whole.Western myths (both ancient and modern) are universally messianic, and can most easily be traced back to the story of David and Goliath. Whether the scrappy rebels of Star Wars led by Luke Skywalker, or the Fellowship of the Ring and its unlikely Frodo, the stories we tell ourselves are about the righteous few overcoming the all seeing false god, the oppressive empire. While it's a trope that never fails to inspire, the problem lies in its subjectivity. When a captured member of ISIS explained his motivations to his FBI interrogator, he said, ""You can't truly understand what Star Wars is to our culture. In my world, you are the Empire. I am Luke Skywalker.""The basic flaw of our most popular myth is that taken to its extreme, it can only inspire jihad. The popular understanding of Dune's legacy is in all that it came to inspire -- the desert world of Tattooine, the production design of 80's science fiction, not to mention the careers of many creators who went on to completely shape the visual palette of our modern stories. Upon rereading, I saw even more evidence of this: beat-for-beat, the entire first ""book"" of Dune (its first 200 pages, also called ""Dune"") closely resembles the plot of A Game of Thrones, and its second and third ""books"" offer a dim outline of the rest of that series. But each reiteration of the source text focuses only on aspects of the original: GoT invests in deep political scheming between houses, while Star Wars focuses on adventure and on the lightest interpretation of the messiah.Jodorowsky's Dune by comparison, was immersed in the messianic, but for different purposes: instead of empire, Jodo himself wanted to suggest an alternate motivation for travelling to the stars. As with his most well-known experimental work, The Holy Mountain, Jodo was interested in exploration for its own sake, as a means of touching and realizing the Divine. In a poem written to one of the artists on his unmade Dune film, Jodo wrote, ""I want magical entities, vibrating vehicles/Like fish of a timeless ocean. I want/Jewels, mechanics as perfect as the heart/Womb-ships anterooms/Rebirth into other dimensions/I want whore-ships driven/By the sperm of passionate ejaculations/In an engine of flesh...""The first (and easiest) question that arises here is what our cultural landscape would look like if Jodorowsky had been able to make Dune before George Lucas cannibalized many of Jodo's production ideas in order to make Star Wars. The answer may be ""not very different"": after all, Kubrick's 2001 was released long before either of the other productions, and boasted special effects quite superior to Star Wars in its original incarnation. Lucas' film supplied action, excitement, and an accessible narrative quite unlike anything that either Kubrick or Jodorowsky ever wanted to attempt.All this discussion of film sees itself reflected in the Dune novels in much the same way. For some reason, despite the fact that its undoubtedly a well-known book, Dune carries with it the stigma of being somewhat overlooked. I think that this is in part due to its inaccessibility -- not only are its first 200 pages unforgivably dense, but the rest of the book switches tone somewhat regularly, and many of its most important plot points are explained in twenty pages of appendices, or (for the truly masochistic) its 23-page index. Even within its fandom, most readers will attest to the fact that each successive volume in the series decreases in quality, and that Herbert's son's attempt to finish the series after his father's death in no way shakes the feeling that this will always be an unfinished work. Hand in hand with its inaccessibility is the series' ""unadaptability,"" due to a combination of factors: a spotty track record that's given it a somewhat Macbeth-esque feeling of being a ""cursed work,"" the Herbert estate's relative resistance to allow adaptation (or even internet fan-fiction!), and the very real possibility that its material has been mined so thoroughly that further attempts to broaden its audience through adaptation would feel ironically derivative.All of which returns to the central question: is Dune best left where it is? Does it have anything additional to say that has not already been said?I would argue that Dune's key contribution, and one that has never been reinterpreted, its its unique understanding of the dangerous nature of the messiah. When I read the first Dune trilogy two years ago, I was bothered by the seeming lack of fallibility in both of its messiah characters, Paul and Leto II. Paul is depicted as more thoughtful and intuitive than most of the first novel's characters, but his belief that assuming control in order to prevent jihad is a disturbingly prideful one. Leto II (almost laughably) attains power through transforming himself into a giant phallus. Idolatry of the masculine ideal is a huge problem in fantasy and science fiction, particularly in the decades during which these novels were written, and so on my first reading I assumed that Dune was simply a product of its time.Upon rereading, I think that Herbert was actually more interested in this critique of power than I originally understood, and I think my own blind spot in seeing this critique is partially due to the fact that I wasn't used to looking for it. Paul Atreides begins the story as a vulnerable and sympathetic character beset with responsibility and threatened by the adults around him. However, by the book's end, Paul is a character to be feared, and subsequent books further emphasize the monstrousness of his family's abuse of power. This does not, by any means, make the other Houses and factions within Dune any less hideous, and the fact that the series lacks a good/evil binary might be its most important commentary. Although we know the adage that ""absolute power corrupts absolutely,"" its simplest form is, simply, that ""power corrupts."" The problem is that in our modern myths, we have mutated this adage further: ""power corrupts...unless I wield it.""We do not live in a world in which our stories tell us what really happens when good people take power. In Star Wars, Luke is tempted by the Dark Side -- but not really. Mostly he just wears a leather glove. Frodo is corrupted by Sauron, but he was never meant to rule anyway. Even Anakin Skywalker just becomes Darth Vader in order to redeem himself in his old age. In Dune, heroes are only heroic when they strive to take power from the powerful -- to disseminate, rather than to assume. Upon assumption of power, heroes suffer the same corruption as their enemies, and that corruption worsens in direct correlation with that hero's spiritual connection to the universe. With this in mind, it may be that Herbert is suggesting something sinister not just about the nature of Man, but the nature of Nature itself. As Werner Herzog famously suggested, ""the common denominator of the universe is not harmony; but chaos, hostility and murder.""When I think about what Dune could have been, I'm mostly interested in how our myths might have influenced us if we saw our enemy not in the faces of the powerful, but in the nature of power itself.01/06/14: I have never tried and failed to read a book more times than Dune, and even when I committed for-real-this-time last summer, there was a month or two in the middle where I almost gave up again. I have no idea what the big effing deal was -- people like, really like this book, right? And then even some are like ""yeah, this book and the other five after that, and if I'm some sort of nerd all the bajillion extended-universe Dune books too,"" to which I'm like holy crap, I've been trying to read Dune since I was like fourteen, so perhaps I will finish the second one sometime before I am dead. So I really don't know if it's my own sense of accomplishment (hand-in-hand with still not really understanding why this took so long), or just the book's intoxicating mix of sci-fi and politics and mysticism that's clouding my judgment. I know like less than a week ago I was hating on this book for yet another bunch of murky chapters of expositional wandery blablablah whoGIVESashit in the late middle, and I still have no idea how the story gets away with indiscrimnantly skipping forward in time whenever-the-hell-it-chooses and introducing new main characters and made-up words and plot points up until the last 30 pages or so. I don't know how it pulls off forty pages of appendices that actually feel meaningful and not pretentious.And it's probably just a lifetime of being infused with Dune trickle-down, from Star Wars and The Doors on forward through Mad Max and Altered States and Wrath of Khan and Stargate and Fifth Element and Sleep's Dopesmoker and Alan Moore's Promethea and even fucking Tank Girl, all of which equate the alienating displacement of science-fiction with understanding Truth, and getting high in the desert on sandworm juice with knowing God. Who knows what kind of total associational backwash has contributed to me sitting here thinking I think my own thoughts when I'm really just letting decades of other people's thoughts reverberate and work themselves into my post-apocalyptic RPG campaigns? But this:""The future - the graycloud-future - with its feeling that the entire universe rolled toward a boiling nexus hung around him like a phantom world.""An entire book of sentences that should be terrible but are instead perfect.Point of fact - I don't know if the long journey in getting to this moment at 11:30 am on a Monday where I have finally finished Dune, twenty years after trying to read it for the first time, has basically just brainwashed and indoctrinated me so that I'm now just willing to let this be a minor religious experience, or what.Pointier of fact - I think it's impossible to know to what part of the Dune cultural footprint I am actually reacting.But: man. This fucking book. Holy shit, this fucking book. I would be running around door-to-door telling everyone to read it, if they already hadn't. I would be saying ""WAIT, why aren't we all talking about this book all the time, because I think my brain and heart are exploding just thinking about it.""If that weren't really stupid, I would absolutely do just that. All over you. ...more"

Because of the importance of this spice, many different political entities want to control it. When the Emperor decides it is time for one of the many Great Houses, House Atreides, to take over rule of the planet of Dune, from House Harkonnen, conflict ensues. The Harkonnens, led by Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, wants to assassinate Duke Leto Atreides, the new ruler of Dune, and Duke Leto knows about the possible assassination, but wants to take advantage of it in a counter-attack.Paul, Duke Letoâs son, and heir, is being bred by his mother to become the first male Benne Gesserit, a religious group with cognitive abilities, so that Paul can become a leader like none other. The inhabitants of Dune are called the Freman people and they are a very mysterious group that survive in the harshest conditions. When Paul is welcomed into the Freman peopleâs society, he might possibly be the prophesied savior of the Freman people, and of all Dune.Review:It is extremely difficult to review a book that is considered the greatest science fiction book of all time, a book that is loved by so many readers. Dune is a book that was so far ahead of its time when it was released in the 1960âs from all other science fiction because of the intricacies of the plot, the world building, and the complex political system. The connections that Dune has with the real world are the things that master thesis are written about and something that, honestly, I do not have the expertise to talk about. Suffice to say that world conservation, religion, addiction, and natural resources are all something that Dune draws a parallel to our real world. I just donât have the intelligence nor the expertise to review Dune based off its influence to science fiction and how amazing it was when it was written. I can only review Dune, as a book, read by me today. I understand that Dune is many peopleâs favorite book, and I understand itâs importance on the influence of science fiction, but I can only review Dune based on my experience, at this moment.Firstly Duneâs narrative is an engaging story of revenge. I really like the setup that Herbert created for this story. He could have introduced us to the story at many different points, but the introduction was just perfect. There was just enough backstory to get the story moving and then things just start rolling along. The political setup is absolutely fantastic and that is comparing it to current books. It is complex enough to use your brain but not enough to be confusing. The story progresses at an even pace with unforgettable scenes that I will remember forever. The chapters where the Freman people are explained and their riveting response to water was just captivating.Herbertâs world building is great for even now, 50 years after the book was released. In an age when robots and computers dominated science fiction, Herbert asked what the future would be like if people turned from technology, and embraced religion more. Most of your science fiction turns away from religion but Herbert embraces it. The Freman are an iconic race of desert people that just completely fascinated me. Even though some of their ways may seem barbaric or without reason, it made for a very interesting world.The part of Herbertâs world I had an issue with is the mysticism of the precognitive mystical abilities. I felt the narrative and world was strong enough without introducing inner-eye, seeing the future, aspects to the main character, that really didnât offer the reader much. I would have enjoyed the book much more if Paul would have become this powerful leader on his own merit, maybe with some Benne Gesserit manipulation, but without his seemingly âmagicalâ abilities. I just didnât care for his abilities to see the future and thought it detracted from the story, especially when written randomly in the middle of a scene.Even though Herbertâs writing was not too outdated, the randomness of the scenes, was something I never got used to. Many times characters would be conversing about one subject and then the subject or point of view would change so drastically that it felt like I missed a line of text. I would go back and reread the previous paragraph, to only find out that Herbert jumped the flow of the scene to something completely different. Many times, the mystical abilities were thrown in the middle of a scene, and that took you completely out of the book. Lastly about Herbertâs writing is that there were descriptions of the setting or characters that was either uncomfortable or just downright odd. The word choices were so jarring at times that it threw me out of the story or made me shake my head in confusion why he would explain something in that way.Lastly, even though the characters were alright characters, I never became attached to any of them. I was more attached to the planet of Dune than any of the characters. The character I felt like I knew the most and was the most interesting was the antagonist Baron. Paul just wasnât a likable character for me, and his struggle against the future he saw for his people did not impact me at all.Overall the heavy use of religion and mysticism just didnât work for me. I just really didnât find Paulâs abilities reasonable or explainable to a degree that I was comfortable with. Regardless, I did enjoy the book, and I understand why some people love this book as much as they do. It is a good book, there were just things that were not for me. I am extremely happy to have read and enjoyed this book. A part of me thinks that I should of read this book earlier in my life and I would have appreciate it more. There are so many scenes that will stick with me for a long time....more

But Baron Vladimir Harkonnen hates House Atreides and doesn't like how his House has been pushed out, so he plans a coup. Meanwhile, Paul begins to learn of his destiny and special purpose.This book is a science fiction classic, and I've been recommended it many, many times. Finally, I broke down and borrowed the audiobook to get a glimpse at this great work.The first thing I noticed when reading Dune was how detailed it was. Herbert really thought about how life would be on a desert world, and I was impressed and intrigued at his effort. I even believed it was possible to have such a desert world. In some ways, Arakkis is more real to me than even Tatooine (and I am a HUGE Star Wars fan!). The way the Fremen acted, the thought that sand is like water, the care for preserving moisture...all of these helped make Arrakis real and believable.Secondly, Herbert doesn't cheapen his characters just to show off his stuff in the planetology or politics department. My favorite character was Jessica. Herbert didn't make Jessica some stupid sexy woman who is only in the story to boink the main character. I felt Jessica was well written, smart, and active. Plus, I really was impressed how Herbert made her proficient in the use of the Wielding Way, a psuedo-martial arts. Other notable characters are Duke Leto, Stilgar and Count Fenring.But something else became obvious. The first section is slow and confusing. I wanted to give up so often, but didn't because of others cheering me on. After I got past the first part, however, the writing was somehow easier and more interesting. I was particularly interested in the big coup between the Harkonnens and the Atreides. But, around the time the story skips forward in time, I found myself drifting away. And the ending confused me and slightly bored me. So this uneven pacing and uneven interest does somewhat taint my impression of Dune...Now, before I get splattered with tomatoes, I do have a reason why this might be that doesn't include ""It's the author's fault"". I listened to this on audiobook (albeit unabridged, so I can't blame it on the audiobook being abridged), so it's possible that I missed something while listening, perhaps while finding my place, resuming in the middle of a section or just toning out and not paying 100% attention. So I would like to one day read this in book format so that I can fill the gaps and see if the novel drifts off the same way I experienced on audiobook.I also never really liked Paul. So many call him ""older than his years"", but I almost found him to be an impertinent, know-it-all twerp. Was it the audiobook again and my attention to it that is to blame or my perception of the book in general?I don't like reading about four year olds that act much older than their age, so when I read about Alia, I cringed. I will admit, that Herbert had probably the best explanation for her worldly wisdom, but I still hate children like that and had to fight myself against hating Alia outright.Although this book has a tough beginning to go through, it really does get more interesting. I also can't help but be awed at how well Herbert thought out Arakkis and the great characters Herbert filled his world with. The latter tends to be nearly unheard of in science fiction, hence the ""Space Babe"" and ""Super Hero"" male protagonist stereotypes that are flung around. I won't lie, I didn't like how slow it was, how much talking about everything that occurred, and how odd the ending is. And I wouldn't recommend anyone listen to this on audiobook as I did. I think I missed out on a lot of things (such as the appendices, which appear only at the end of the audiobook, and the glossary, which would have saved me many trips to Wikipedia). But I think anyone who likes science fiction should give this a try, if only to see a classic scifi novel. I can truly see why this is to scifi as Lord of the Rings is to fantasy....more"

Before I read it, I'd seen the movie multiple times, and the mini-series - both the Dune one and the Children of Dune one. I'd also been told all the differences between the books and both of these things from my insane boyfriend who's read it 27 times to date.That said - it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. Not that I didn't enkoy the movie, the mini-series, or the lectures - but because I was warned it was rather dry reading and might not be quite up my alley.It sort of was and wasn't.On one hand, I found it interesting. I enjoyed, on an intellectual level, anyway, the outlining and commentary on religion and politics. My favorite parts about the religious stuff is both the way that it can be used to control people, and also the way that people are lost to their own legends. I'm pretty certain that most of the people and ideas and whatnots that modern religions are based on would be appalled at what's become of them - the way things have altered, been forgotten, or changed - either out of zealotry, ignorance, or tyranny.But, for all that, these weren't ground-breaking thoughts to me. Perhaps if I read this book when I was younger and less cynical, I'd be more profoundly affected by the truisms therein.As an intellectual exercise, it was one of the better ones.As a story though?I never really emotionaly connected with it. I hated Jessica. I liked her at first, but as the story progressed I just found myself more and more irritated by her, and sort of wished she was just shut up. I couldn't get a grasp on Paul as a person. Gurney was ok, but then disappears for most of the book. I also never connected with Stilgar as a person. The characters were all sort of thin, and there more for their role in the plot than as fleshed out people.I liked Channi, though. I've always liked Channi, in all the various versions of the story I've seen/read. And Alia, though I would've liked to have seen more of her.I found the Fremen interesting. Their mix on enlightenment and barbarism. The way women can be revered in one sense, and treated like chattle in another. The always odd to me notion of a culture in which death comes easy, life is cheap - and yet so much can hang on the balance of it at the same time.But, again, I found it interesting, but not emotionally engaging.As for the writing - it was oddly jumpy in places. I don't mean the shifts of thought-perspective. I quite liked that third person omniscience, actually, as we went from one persons thought to another's pretty seamlessly.But within scenes, we would jump to a different scene, and there would be no paragraph break or anything to let you know it's shifted. It was very jarring. The action sequences were sometimes done really well, but other times they were slapdash and hard to follow.And he tended to be repetitive, both in thought-patterns and descriptions. Such as the description of Gurney's ""inkvine scar"". Did this phrase really need to be repeated every time the scar is referenced? That's just the example that stood out the most, but it was a problem through the whole book, really.Anyway - I'm glad I read it, and I didn't hate it, as I feared I would, but, for me, for a book to get 4 or 5 stars I have to connect with it not just intellectually, but also emotionally, and this just never got there. But it was interesting, and it was worth the read....more"

The story remains the same but my experience of it continues to evolve. I recently found a real-life person who loves this book as much as I do (actually more). Talking about this book and the other books in the series really made me need to do a reread. But this is one of the most complicated and fascinated books with a little bit of everything. It talks about environmentalism, politics, love within that context, anthropology, religion, and everything in between. I remember falling absolutely in love with Paul as a kid, and I continue to do so as an adult because I actually understand him more, in a way where I know that I can't fully understand him, in the way that Oscar Wilde said, ""I am not young enough to know everything."" I've also noticed that every time I read it I am affected more by the tragedies that befall the characters. I think one of the most powerful things that hit me about Paul is that he loses someone and feels bereft at his inability to grieve. He has to push away that grief for a time, not acknowledge it, so that he can continue to survive. He can only allow himself to grieve once he knows he is safe, but you have to know that he is only delaying his utter agony over his losses. I think Paul feels an awful lot more than he ever shows to his people, and even to his readers. I just can't help getting teary-eyed, which always leads me to think ""I give water to the dead/fictional!"" This book is just amazing, and one of my favorites ever....more"

Much in this book is internal. Herbert spends a lot of time in various characters' heads, because nobody shows anything. It's the culture of the greater world Dune is set in. This can take some getting used to, to be honest, and I can see where some people would find it off-putting. I wouldn't say that I loved that style, but I did feel like it worked, and that it was necessary. I've seen some complaints, here and there, about being thrown into the deep end with this book. And in a way, that's true. You are not eased into the world of Dune. There's a certain amount of culture shock at first. And the first 75 or so pages are on the slow side, but that gave me plenty of time to get acclimated. Once I had settled in to the Dune world, so to speak, it all started to make more sense.Now, the story itself. It has very mythic overtones, very intentionally. And it certainly doesn't feel like a standalone work. It left me wanting to at least read the books Frank Herbert wrote himself, though I'll probably skip the ones his son wrote. In the end, I did feel like this book lived up to its reputation. I'd hesitate to recommend it to a lot of people, though, because of that very particular style. Not everybody will like it, and some may be actively put off by it. For me, it worked, and so did the book as a whole....more

Right? Everyone has? EVERYONE!I hadnât, so I finally broke down and took the plunge. Anytime thereâs a book like this, a classic, a quintessential piece of sci-fi/fantasy, I canât help but go in with some preconceived notions. I knew very little about Dune prior to the book, to be honest â I could name some of the quotes from it, I understood some of the âspiceâ references, etc. However, Iâd never read any of it, never seen any of the media from it, and had largely stayed ignorant to the story, which I think is a good thing.With Dune, I had some odd expectations â I canât say why, but I kind of figured it would be a bit more stuffy, a bit more in the classical sparse 60s sci-fi style, a book based more on great ideas than great content. To a large degree, I couldnât have been more wrong. Dune, in the end, is a book about people, focused on people, starring people â the world, while immensely creative, unique, and still holding up through the test of time, was a background mosaic for the driving force of the story â Paul, Jessica, and the rest of the cast were terrific, unique, strong characters with excellent dialogue, and strong convictions.Dune surrounds the interstellar planet Arrakis, a desert planet whose importance lies in the fact it was the only source of melange, or the spice. Melange was a drug with many positive effects, one of which being providing a nearly clairvoyant sense to those with the ability to process it as such. The story follows Paul Atreides, the son of the Duke Leto Atreides, who was a flawed but well liked duke of the House Atreides. All planets in the system are controlled by the Great Houses, answering to the Emperor, the cunning Shaddam. Sensing a threat to his power, Shaddam hands control of Arrakis over to Leto Atreides, while plotting with the former ruler of the planet, the fairly black-and-white evil Vladimir Harkonenn, to use the opportunity to remove Leto Atreides from the picture.One of the major values of the spice is the future-seeing and other mental stimulating effects it has, namely on the powerful Bene Gesserit, a powerful matriarchal group with distinct and trained mental abilities, as well as the capability of passing on all memories and knowledge to others. Jessica, Duke Letoâs concubine, is a powerful Bene Gesserit, and is mistrusted by nearly all due to those ties, as well as her perceived ulterior motives. The Bene Gesserit, as it is revealed, have been undertaking a long term breeding program to try and produce a single powerful male version of the Bene Gesserit, though this remains largely a secret to anyone outside of Bene Gesserit circles.Upon arrival to Arrakis, the Atreides are immediately set upon in numerous ways, including traps and plots to attempt to kill the powerful members of the family. They are eventually betrayed by a member of their own house, and the family is splintered apart and struggling to survive. Eventually, Jessica and Paul find themselves in the company of the Fremen, the native people to Arrakis, used as essentially forced servants to harvest and distribute the spice to the Empire. The Fremen have adapted to the harsh living conditions of Arrakis, including the sand and sandstorms, as well as the sand worms.Sand worms?Sand worms. Like, big ones, huge ones. The sand worms, referred to as âmakersâ by the Fremen in reference to the fact that they are responsible for the pockets under the sand that create melange, are a massive problem to the inhabitants of the planet, as they often grow to massive proportions and attack aggressively. With the aid of the Fremen, Jessica and Paul integrate into their society, becoming leaders, and as Paulâs powers begin to emerge, he takes his place as the Duke Atreides, and teams with the Fremen to eventually make a push at both Vladimir Harkonnen, and the Emperor Shaddam.Dune caught me a bit off guard, with the amount of deep political and interpersonal drama it contained, as well as the incredibly well-done method Herbert employed to present it. His prose wasnât legendary, in my opinion, but it had a great flow, the dialogue was terrific, and his sense of atmosphere was exceptional. I felt like I was sucked into this world, scared of these worms, scared of the betrayals, nervous for the characters.Dune was one of those rare occasions where I read something that was well established, very highly praised, and intensely popular, and found it to be everything it was claimed to be and more. I truly enjoyed this novel, start to finish, and while there were some lulls and slow periods, it moved along at a good pace, and was pleasurable throughout.I suppose I should get around to reading more of these older, well-regarded novels.Rating: 4.5 / 5...more

You donât spoil the ending right away. And if you do, you donât keep reminding the reader about it. Yet look at here, the beginning of every chapter has a passage from a scripture that was written after the story is over. We know the outcome because they keep mentioning it.And I know what many of you will be thinking; the destination does not matter the most, itâs the journey towards it. Just because you know where you are going does not mean you know exactly how you will get there. I would accept that if the journey had to do with traveling by mundane means, but not when itâs about divine intervention, where you teleport anywhere the plot wants you to be. There is no meaningful journey when you can skip most of the challenges. Thatâs the fundamental flaw with the book, the protagonist is another space Jesus who we all know he will win right away because the outcome is known. Have fun not being worried if he might get killed by the dangers he faces. But this is not what everybody hypes the book for, since all the attention was placed on the world building, which I admit itâs bloody amazing. The images of the desert, the glamorous palaces, and the underground caves are fascinating for a mind that loves to visualize alien sceneries. You are also bombarded with all sorts of terminology and there is even the long glossary as an appendix to help you understand what each weird name is supposed to be about. In this regard the book is very looked into. I canât say the same thing for the characterization, which is fairly cartoony, especially for the villains. The Harkonnen are pretty much a bunch of ugly fat gay pedophiles who rub their hands and wish to kill all that is good in the universe for money. You can work around this issue if you imagine how this is supposed to be a recollection of events that transpired. You are basically told the story from the perspective of the victors; meaning, you are reading a historical documentary written by the general who won the war. Of course and the villains will be shallow archetypes of evil, and of course the good guys will be too ideal. Itâs a placebo solution, but it sure is better than to call Dune a fairy tale in space. The exposition is also weak, since the characters will be explaining in detail things that donât require it in-story. Ok, they do so the reader can understand what is going on, but with the option of internal monologues, an unseen narrator, or even the glossary that is already there to fill the blanks, explaining everything with boring infodumps is plain silly.And then there is the plot, which is completely retarded. The premise and the set-up are amazing, the execution of them is terrible, especially when it comes to the emperor of the galaxy. We are told the house of Harkonnen did a poor job at gathering spice, so the emperor replaces them with the house of Atreides. The Atreides did a much better job and so the emperor orders their destructionâ¦ Yeah, ok, anything you say boss. I understand that he was afraid of them getting powerful enough to rival him, but itâs not like he couldnât replace them with a simple command, just like he did with the Hakonnen. How about assigning the task to multiple houses, so nobody will get too powerful to rival you, idiot? Also, is this guy ever satisfied? The Harkonnen didnât do well, the Atreides did too well, heâs displeased either way. Not to mention the final battle where he personally comes to the battlefield for no reason whatsoever, and even lands his ship in the middle of a hostile area, although he has thousands of clerics who are predicting the future and constantly warn him about it. How has this empire not self-destroyed a few days after this idiot sat on the throne? Not that the rest of the characters are any smarter. The leader of the Atreides kept yapping about being aware and careful on one hand, while obviously doing his best to be more popular than the emperor, thus causing his wrath. The leader of the Harkonnen sends the son and mother of the Atreides to die slowly by the harsh weather of the desert. And no more than a few minutes later, he sends ships to kill them! Why didnât you simply kill them while you had them in your hands, if that was your intention all along? As you can obviously imagine, the two of them escape, join a tribe of natives, and quickly raise an army of ragged civilians who can wipe out the elite armies of the empire. Bullshit. There is a lot more to the story, such as the protagonist riding huge worms, storming the evil bossâs fort, and monopolizing trade with his hax mind controlling skills. Itâs dumb fun and it would work if it didnât try to be anything more. Something which unfortunately does, since there are long dialogues about politics, religion, and ecology, which do not matter in the longrun, since everything comes down to the CHOSEN ONE doing everything right and winning all the time with the power of deus ex machina. At least he doesnât save everybody; most of the people he loved are dead by the end of the war. But still, he is space Jesus, there is nothing to relate with. Most remember Dune for the philosophy and the setting, and if you go easy on it, itâs fun for the genre. I personally wasnât that amused since it felt too simple in plot and characters, while at the same time trying to overcomplicate everything and being full of eye rolling moments. Itâs an average read at best and pretty flawed from a critical perspective....more

It's what I would have liked then.But I didn't read it then; I read it now, in 2013 as a still fairly young, but starting to feel my age as I near the almost-thirtieth year, especially when I look in the mirror at my hair (which keeps marching further up my scalp to expose my pale dome) and my stomach (which is currently imitating the undulating quality of a bowl full of jelly). I read it as an adult who has read George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, the current pinnacle of fantasy writing.Dune and A Song of Ice and Fire have many similarities and it was impossible for me not to compare the two. Each feature ruling families who find themselves in the middle of a mess of political intrigue, assassination, sex, poison, et cetera. Herbert wrote giant sand worms; Martin wrote dragons. They both wrote characters with telepathic powers. They both wrote complicated religions and dynasties with their respective hundreds of years of history and mythology. They both even share the willingness to kill of important characters for seemingly no reason.The thing is (and I must declare that this is simply my humble opinion), Martin does everything better than Herbert. Martin brings characters to life and makes you love them or loathe them. Herbert didn't do that for me at all. All of the characters in Dune felt either like robots or like the dullards you find in the cubicle next to you who think it's still hilarious to greet you with a ""wasssssss uuuppppp"". Dune has a lot of head, but no heart. And while there's a lot in the plot, it all feels very plodding. A plodding plot that ends with a whimper, not a bang.But I still gave it three stars. So it's not terrible. I just don't understand the hype....more"

We tend to flounder around, blaming everything but the actual, deep-seated thing thatâs really chewing on us.The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience.This, to many, is the preeminent high-octane, complex world-building, philosophically laced science fiction book and I am not going to argue with these people. This is one heck of a book, it does all of these aforementioned things well. This book has innumerable spectacular nuggets -quotes- to choose from and develops a unique universe with great depth. The action is excellent and often full of delightful twists. The antagonists are deliciously horrid and many of the protagonists enjoyably grey. After having finished this book I am filled with a sense of a thin layer of controlled calmness overlaying constant peril (constant). This book is jam-packed with philosophy and dense world building that is tons of fun, and while at times stilted, the writing is still enjoyable - but for this reader all was a bit exhausting. Please do not get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed most of the book, and I feel like if I take it apart it's pieces are spectacular, but as a whole it was too adrenaline laden and, dare I say, rushed. This was a book that simultaneously seemed both too long and too short. It is part of a series and as the book ended I feel compelled to read on, but not at this time - I need to leave the people of Arrakis where they are, in constant peril and high on both spice and demi-god/leader worship. Much to love in this book, but like Asimov's Foundation trilogy, this sci-fi masterpiece didn't quite hit the sweet spot (or cinnamon-y, dry-mouthed spot, as it were) for this humble reader....more"

It is considered one of the greatest science fiction novels ever written and has won both the Hugo and Nebula awards. However, I feel that it has been over hyped over the years.Starting with the positives, Frank Herbert has created a very in depth and real world with Arrakis, the different races of people, the religions. The world building was fantastic! The ideas that he put into this novel are very original and have obviously left their mark within science fiction. A lot of time is spent describing the world to the very smallest of detail, which I think is very important when an author has created something so big, you basically need to be able to eventually read a word and instantly know what it is, and that is what Frank Herbert has done extremely well. However, this novel is let down by the lack of character building and a staggered story line that at times isn't very engaging. I feel that the only real character building we got was really with Paul and Jessica. Everyone else felt like an 'extra'. This was then backed up by the staggered story line where at one pointed traveled 6 years later, with no real description of what happened in those 6 years, save for a few events that weren't really described either. I said on one of my progress updates that the first 170 pages were slow and then it picked up really fast for about 70 pages, and then went back to being slow again and then eventually picked up again. When I say ""slow"" I don't meant that there wasn't much action, but the flow of the book was slow and was at times a struggle to get through. But I was rewarded with a climatic ended, which felt very loose and could have been so much better. With books of this size, I usually feel that there is a great payoff, but this felt a very sudden ending that just felt like an end of a chapter rather than the end of a book of 600 pages. Overall, it is clear than Dune is one of the most important science fiction novels ever written, and built the foundation of what the genre is today. It is a very good story with great ideas, but is let down by the flat characters and sluggish story telling at times. I do recommend that you read it if you already haven't, but don't expect it to blow you away....more"

I was thoroughly entertained, yet at the same time I felt that enlightenment that comes when reading something truly original and influential. The learning curve at the start is fairly steep but so engaging that I wasn't turned off by the foreign terminology. And I think it's actually because of that steep world building that the book was so immersive, and full of depth.As I read I recognized some of the seeds that probably sparked some of my favorite modern fiction. I was reminded of the galactic empirical tyranny of Pierce Brown's Red Rising Trilogy. I noticed similarities in world building elements of Brandon Sanderson's The Stormlight Archive as well as his first unpublished novel White Sand.If you haven't read it, don't be afraid. Dive in!

As a relative newcomer to sci-fi, having only really read the likes of H.G. Wells before, I felt that Dune would be a perfect (if slightly ambitious) place to properly start. Unfortunately, it didn't quite meet the expectations that I felt had been set for it, at least for me personally.Dune introduces us to the character of Paul Atreides, who arrives on the planet Arrakis (otherwise known as Dune) from his home planet Caladan, when his father the Duke Leto Atreides is given control over the spice-mining operations. Spice, or melange, is an incredibly lucrative drug which not only improves life but also can extend it. However, the Harkonnens, the long-time enemies of the Atreides house, plan to take control and eliminate the Atreides family. Let it be known that I had to briefly check Wikipedia to make sure that my knowledge of the basic plot of Dune was in fact correct. Although I have just finished the book this morning, certain details still remain fuzzy, and that to me always leads to warning bells going off in my mind about how much I really enjoyed a book.Herbert is very talented when it comes to world-building. The plot of this novel was very complex and well thought-out, maybe a little too complex for the likes of me, and the political battles were very nuanced and subtle in places. It was clear that a great deal of planning and thought had gone into his world, backed up by the fact that his son was able to continue on the series even after Frank Herbert had passed away, from the extensive notes he had made. However, I found it very difficult to become fully absorbed in the world of Arrakis, and this lessened my enjoyment of the book overall.My main issue was the characters - Herbert may be able to write a killer world, but in my opinion he falls incredibly short of the mark when it comes to writing memorable characters. Almost every character in the book I found to be incredibly two-dimensional, with a voice common to all that meant I found it hard to distinguish between certain roles (particularly with more secondary characters). Paul himself I found to be incredibly unlikeable, particularly towards the end of the book, and I found that I couldn't really sympathise with him. His mother Jessica thought a little too much about things for my personal tastes, and I found reading about her to be more trouble than it was worth. The only character that I felt I genuinely liked was that of Stilgar, a Fremen who I felt had a much more commanding presence than Paul Atreides had.There were moments in this book where I felt that the story definitely picked up, usually times of discovery or fight scenes, but there was far too much in the way of dull, political conversation for my liking. I would have maybe bumped this up to a 3 out of 5 if it wasn't for the fact that I felt a certain fight with a certain character at the end of the book was wrapped up way too quickly - so quickly, in fact, that I didn't realise it had even ended!Overall I can see why people are fanatical about this series, but it just wasn't really for me. I won't be continuing on with this series, as I don't think I enjoy Herbert's writing style enough to want to know what happens next. And, as I've heard from many people that the later books are not very good at all, that's even more reason to let this series alone. However, if you are a sci-fi fan and want to try this classic, you may well enjoy it a great deal more than I did! I'm just glad I stepped out of my comfort zone to give this one a fair go....more

Preparations are under way to leave their homeland in Caladan and journey to the Arrakis planet of Dune, previously ruled by the brutal Harkonnen regime. On this new planet, they will experience peril at every turn from the evil Harkonnens, a traitor from within, and the harsh physical landscape where water is scarce and giant sandworms roam among the precious spice commodity. In this visionary work of Science Fiction, we open on the Duke of Atreides, his concubine Jessica, and their son Paul. Preparations are under way to leave their homeland in Caladan and journey to the Arrakis planet of Dune, previously ruled by the brutal Harkonnen regime. On this new planet, they will experience peril at every turn from the evil Harkonnens, a traitor from within, and the harsh physical landscape where water is scarce and giant sandworms roam among the precious spice commodity.  As in most created worlds, it takes me an hour or two of intense concentration, occasional notetaking, and @100 pages to become invested in the story. This was no different. This novel was published fifty years ago, has been made into a movie and sci-fi channel series, and been discussed thousands of times. I don't think I'll have any earth shattering observations, so will just share what I loved and what was slightly problematic for me. There are so many things to appreciate with the construct of the story. The world-building is incredibly detailed, with rich history for all groups of people. The precarious balance of power is fascinating and keeps the tension/suspense element present! I love the concept of any novel that explores the scarcity of a certain commodity, and how that can change people's daily lives. In this case, spice and water. The desert and structure descriptions were simply fantastic. I thought the writing was good in most parts, like this observation: ""Always before, Staff had ended on an incisive air. This meeting had just seemed to trickle out, worn down by it's own inadequacies, and with an argument to top it off."" Quite succinct, and really highlights the mood. I was a big fan of the italicized portions at the beginning of each segment (often written by Princess Irulan), which provided history and often great foreshadowing for the book. I think this had one of the most incredible villains. I liked the grotesque physical descriptions that were excellently repulsive! Specific examples would be ""thick purple hands"" ""copious jowls"" and ""baby-fat hands"". ICK. I had some trouble with all the prophecies, legends, and visions that came to Paul and his mother. While I loved the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood element, some dreams went on too long and I wanted the action to move forward without a confusing/muddled dream sequence. Some of the descriptions seemed nonsensical and rambling, and became tedious to me. The visions always seemed fevered, but perhaps that is explored more in book two...or maybe I just need to concentrate and reread.  I can see why it is a landmark of Science Fiction and I'm pleased that I had the experience of reading such a beautiful edition. While I appreciated the imaginative work and rich world building, I'm not sure I'll be continuing with the series at the moment. I'm glad that this sufficed as a standalone, but that I'll be able to find plenty of material if I choose to return to this world. I recommend to anyone who wants to read a classic in the genre!...more"

We are introduced to the Guild, Fremen, other great Houses, the Bene Gesserit, Mentats, many religions and so, so much more. I'm amazed at how detailed a picture Herbert is able to paint in relatively few pages for it's scope. This, the first in the series, is basically the end of status quo in the Empire. Paul Atreides and the Fremen bring about a new age, and it's long overdue. Dune is divided into three ""books"". In the first book that status quo is sketched out, but the other two books are devoted to the coming of the new age. It leaves me hungry for more. Thank goodness Hebert wrote more!I hate to give away any of the plot, but I would like to praise Herbert's skill. He gives us characters that are super intelligent, intuitive, strong, excellent strategists, possessing any number of seemingly super-human abilities. His genius is in the way he shows us these abilities are aquired. These people work to become what they are. They train and study and practice. All the time. From birth sometimes. There are no born superheroes in Herbert's world. There are hardworkers, and yes, a little genetic help, but always work. I can trust these characters actions as true and believable because Herbert has presented them in such a flattering light. Even the bad guys work very, very hard for what they have. They lie, cheat, steal and kill, but they work hard to do so. I find it refreshing that things do not come easily. They require a price. Just like in the real world.The other praiseworthy thing I feel Herbert accomplishes is giving us characters to balance each other out. Paul, who is arguably the main character, becomes less and less like us, so almost unsympathetic, and yet Herbert balances him with Jessica, who, even as she rises, stays emotionally accessible to us. We can sympathize and care about her. We have Stilgar who is honor personified, and yet also unsympathetic in his perfection. The foil to him is Idaho, as honor bound as Stilgar, and yet infinitely more approachable. I love Idaho. I could foil characters from this book off each other for pages, but the idea is the same. He gives us someone we can admire, and someone else we can love. Brilliant! Now I want to go back a re-read them all. I may even break down and read the pre-quels Herbert didn't write. Maybe......more"

Maybe the problem is I have seen the movie so many times that I was simply unable to prevent myself from comparing every line in the book to every scene in the movie. That isnât fair, but I really came to believe that the movie took the best parts of Dune and stripped away all the superfluous meanderings that puff the text up above five hundred pages.MaybeOh, I know Iâm going to incur some wrath over this, but not only didnât I enjoy Dune as I thought I would, I frankly couldnât even finish it.

That isnât fair, but I really came to believe that the movie took the best parts of Dune and stripped away all the superfluous meanderings that puff the text up above five hundred pages.Maybe it is an issue of style. After two hundred pages of internal dialog stretching out every conversation, I felt like Frank Herbert believed every reader was six-years-old or brain damaged. Never before has the idea of âshow, donât tellâ rung so true to me in a story. He simply couldnât allow anything to be veiled â everything had to be conveyed in detail with halting asides on virtually every page. Maybe it was an issue of the characters. Every single one of them is devoid of complexity. They all have a simple reason for being there and never produce a single surprise. The entire conflict was laid out from the very beginning and there was never a shred of suspense as to what the result would be because the narrator made it clear from the beginning what was to happen. Herbert couldnât even allow for the traitor to be a shock â he had to foreshadow that right at the beginning of the book. The characters also have a resolute ability to act incompetent consistently and continuously. No wonder they have to rely on drugs to get around the galaxy. Frankly, Iâm shocked that I dislike Dune as much as I do. As a fan of science fiction and of the movie, I really thought this would be right in my wheelhouse. Alas, the characters were boring and the style of Herbertâs writing made the whole thing unenjoyable for me. I expected when I picked up Dune that I would be starting the year off with something grand. Perhaps it is those expectations being dispelled that leaves me so disenchanted....more

Has that lovely quality of curling into the palm of your hand naturally when you read it but still manages to close flat. The well used nature was hard won by repeated readings over the years.I think I have read Dune 10 times, give or take. I read it in high school on the bus. I read it in college late at night and in the student union. I read it on planes on my way to business meetings. I keep reading it because it blew my mind the first time.There are so many interweaving topics in Dune: It deals in ecology, psychology, philosophy, politics, physics, and a myriad of other subjects. Most good Sci-Fi and Fantasy books have politics and religion but only at a very shallow level. A 'look, back-story! Now over hereâ¦' level. Frank Herbert weaves them into the core of the story in a mostly coherent way that is missing from most Sci-Fi and Fantasy, J. R. R. Tolkien excepted.Maybe it appeals to me because I like complected, epic stories. I know that each time I re-read Dune it looses a bit of itâs magic. The story is not high fiction and it doesnât grow up like I do. But itâs still a good story, and one of my favorite. Dune is one of the books I would want with me if I was lost on an island or, lost in space....more

I was sixteen when Frank Herbert first took me to a journey into this faraway future, to the mysterious desert planet Arrakis, with its giant sandworms, its Bedouin-like inhabitants, the Fremen, and the secretive sisterhood of the Bene Gesserit. The novel explores complex interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion, including human beings' susceptibility to mass manipulation by political propaganda, religious dogma, and sexual temptation, and the importance of self-awareness and self-mastery in resisting these types of control. Intricate and lush, this is one of the most brilliant science fiction novels ever written. Sure, the writing is a bit clumsy and some parts seems dated now, but once you leave your footprints in this vibrant world, the winds of Dune will forever call you back to its shifting desert sands.(P.S.

If you like Sci Fi you have already read this book, and if you like books about the Tudors you should read it too, since the conspiracy of court life is essentially what this book is about...only set on a faraway planet...

It is difficult to not be impressed by Dune. It is one of the most complete and passionate examples of world-building Iâve come across, layered with a vast history and fascinating ideas. However, this is not a book that was enjoyable from start to finish. There are many sections that are unnecessarily drawn out, and I felt that Herbertâs writing slipped into dryness at times when the narrative needed to be advanced.It says a lot that the most enjoyable sections of Dune for me where the Appendices placed after the narrative ends. It is in these sections where Herbertâs writing comes alive and we can see the passion and command that went into his creation of Arrakis and the extended universe. The first two-thirds of the book where we witness Paulâs rise to MuadâDib are where I feel Herbertâs narrative writing is exposed as being on a lower level than his world-building skills. Scenes drag out with a plodding inevitability and the writing often slips into âclinicalâ â it gets the job done but is lacking in the passion that we see when Herbert is writing as an anthropologist/ecologist. Paul himself was a major issue for me, and I will spend a bit of time explaining my problems with him as they are the only major ones I have with Dune. Paul is established at the beginning of the book as a Messiah figure, and that is pretty much all the character development we get. Sure, plenty happens around him as the book progresses, but the Paul we meet at the beginning of the book is the same static image of Paul MuadâDib we are left with at its end. I found it difficult to connect with and care about his journey, because we know â like he himself does - that he could never not succeed right from the start. A good chunk of the book focuses on Paul, but he is never interesting. What is going on around him â now that is where the interest lies. But Paul is Herbertâs narrative lynch-pin he can use to tell us all about Arrakis, and the Empire, and the Spice Economy, and these various fascinating elements of the Universe that would be less interesting if they werenât delivered to the reader through a narrative structure. Herbert needs a narrative to effectively reveal his world to the reader, but for me Paul and his journey just wasnât engaging enough and showed to me where Herbertâs strengths and weaknesses lie. This may make it sound like I didnât enjoy the Dune, but this is not the case. I enjoyed the majority of what I read â I said at the beginning that this is world-building at a complete level, and I stand by that. Characters are well-written and virtually all of the main characters begs you to ask further questions about their pasts. The final few chapters of the book do deliver some solid payoff in terms of resolution, and there is an energy to the final chapter that was missing throughout the majority of the book. I would have read twice and more again Appendices on the various histories and factions, and I am emboldened to start looking into the successive books in the Dune universe as I want to know more.Ultimately, this is a masterpiece in world-building that is hindered by its communication to the reader through a narrative that is often dry. Does the good outweigh the bad? Definitely. Can the slower sections be excused as me being personally picky? I genuinely feel that most readers will notice things slow down, and by the time you reach Book 3 you will lament that there are so few pages left when it looks like things are only starting to pick up. But by the time all is said and done, you will be left with the sense that you have journeyed to someplace different and that the experience was a unique one. I recommend that anyone who feels like the middle chapters of the book are work persevere, because when all is said it done it will feel like work that has paid off. I feel somewhat cruel not giving this a 5-star rating, but I think my reasons for that are justified. This is definitely a review I will return to with some hindsight to see if anything has changed â but for now, Iâll stand by a solid 4-stars overall. ...more

And for the sake of the genre I hope that there are far better pieces available now than there were 50 years ago.I started reading this in the hopes that I would be seeing a good friend soon. He lives in a far-off city, and there was a chance that I would be spending part of my August in that far-off city. This is no longer true, but I am glad to have been pressured into reading this book prior to seeing him again. It will give us something to discuss and disagree about. He loves this book - it is one of his favourites. I saw many things in this book which were good, and many more things which were dated, and just a thing or two that I couldn't enjoy as much as I tried.It should be noted that I have a bias against a great deal of science fiction and fantasy. It isn't that I don't enjoy them - I think the settings are fascinating, actually. When I play video games I often find myself exploring these worlds. But I am suspect of the literary genre despite not having had much interaction with it. It has always struck me as a place for creative minds to explore the impossible for the otherwise possible - which is an exciting and intelligent and difficult thing to do. But, in doing so, they can sometimes create a world without limitations - because the rabbit's hole is deep and, the more unreality you create, the deeper and darker it becomes.This isn't always a bad thing. It sometimes can be.Even after reading the Appendices, I suspect that this is one of the limiting factors affecting Dune. The politics of the place are difficult to grasp by the story itself, and the nature of these ""special powers"" affecting the Bene Gesserit or the Mentat's or the Guild - really? who saw that coming? - are far too unclear. There is a lot of history in this universe which cannot be confined to the format of the novel but which acts as the barrier for the novel's possibilities. Without knowing this history, the book becomes less and less credible. As a reader, credibility matters to me.I also didn't much like the lead character, who I was told many times was 15 years old but acted like a leader, but who himself had mood swings, created an enemy of his mother - who is at times incredibly strong and at times enfeebled - and far too easily accepted the fact that he was a Messiah. Far too easily. Paul Muad'Dib Atreides has powers also - unusual skill in fighting, unusual skill in leading, prescience, an ability to be in many places at once (at least in his mind). He is the Kwisatz Haderach, after all. And he was entirely unbelievable. The unfortunate thing is that you never really get to know any of the characters. Which is surprising given how much time you spend in their heads learning about epiphanies and observations, an incredible awareness to the smallest of changes in the world around them. And they all possessed an unpleasant rationalism that made the great traumas of their world mere barriers to overcome - a truly unusual way for a human, of any strength or ability, to move from trauma to trauma.Many times I caught myself wondering if the author behind this book was a libertarian, though I canât remember when or why now. Something triggered it. Iâm not entirely convinced that he is - he seems keen to replace an old empire with a new one. Many times I caught myself wondering if this was an anti-colonial book, but I convinced myself it wasnât, if only because it believed far too profusely in tribalistic ideals which seem outdated even for a book written in the 1960s. Many times I caught myself wondering if this was a discussion of gender roles, or of power, or of grassroots organization, or of the power of good versus evil. Each time I caught myself wondering if any of this could be in there, or if all of it was in there, or if none of it was. I was hungry to find the master in this masterpiece. I ended up feeling that, even if some of this was in there, even if only one of these things were in there, it would be a stretch for anybody to say that Herbert had really thought through the implications of the story he was writing. Iâm very tempted to say that there is no metaphor here. Iâm likely wrong, but I donât know if I care enough to really go searching for it.Ultimately, the impressive accomplishment here is the pacing and the plot and, perhaps, the world of Dune, Arrakis. The pacing because there is almost always something happening which is of interest. There are no lulls really. Easy to do this when your world has no limits. The plot is also interesting, I suspect, to those people who enjoy this kind of story - one of political intrigue (admittedly, not well handled to be honest) and of a man discovering his destiny (which was surely much more intriguing 50 years ago). The world because it really is the most intriguing aspect of the book - nothing comes close to comparing. In fact, one of the appendices was an ecologists imaginary report about this imaginary world and it seemed a good deal more fascinating to me than the political events of the book. Arrakis must be changed, after all. Arrakis must become a liveable planet.The ending is an embarassment to masterpieces, perhaps even an embarassment to the genre. I only say this because it isnât an ending, and because Dune was, according to some legend Iâve read somewhere on the internet, intended to be a standalone book. None of its seven sequels were planned in advance, but were born of the bookâs popularity.It is a popularity that endures and which baffles me. This isnât a good book. It is a good story - perhaps even a good bedtime story to share with young adults who are looking for a character they can relate to but that they end up hating because heâs unbearable. This isnât fine literature of any sort.I say this having finished the book on a camping trip within hours of my friend having read his first Doris Lessing and saying that every sentence felt like a punch with a fist of hard disgusting truth.Dune isnât fine literature of any sort.And I might still give its sequel a go anyways....more"

Clarke:""Unique... I know of nothing comparable to it except The Lord of the Rings.""Indeed, there seems to be nothing else in the science fiction corpus quite like Dune. An epic in every sense of the word--a scope so vast and a background so rich that Frank Herbert felt it necessary to give us a glossary and a series of appendices. The text is rife with all manner of allusions, riddled with sub-plots and suggestions and intimations of a profound and magnificent history (both real and imagined) of which we will receive only a taste. And through it all, the riveting tale of Paul-Muad'Dib Atreides--the messianic figure whose journey into the echelons of manhood and leadership propels us headlong through this fascinating universe.And coming into this story for the first time in 2010--some 45 years after its initial publication--you can quickly and easily see how it has influenced so much of what came after it. Reading it, I was struck by how much it reminded me of so many of my favorite science fiction milieus from over the years. The feuding noble houses reminded me instantly of the BattleTech franchise--the Succession Wars and the complex alliances and rivalries (the combatants are even referred to as ""Houses""). The demi-medievalism brought to mind images from Star Wars--an empire with all of its pageantry, right down to the glamour of fencing. The ecological concerns suggest the work of Margaret Atwood or Ben Bova--what with all of the world-making and unmaking and the lens that shows how the world makes the men, even as the men make the world. And subtle hints in the galaxy-spanning religiousness that bring to mind Hyperion and A Fire Upon the Deep--the consecrated orders (monastic or merely apparently so) and incantations and mythology and an ear toward histories ancient and unknowable.And in so many ways, this is the science fiction fan's perfect vision of escapist literature. The rise of a mighty warrior in a legendary high-stakes saga where his will is put to the test by insurmountable foes and yet he emerges triumphant.But let down: (""Perhaps epic in scope but..."") âââââBut perhaps that's just it. Even if the novel withstands the test after forty-five years and remains as canon Epic Sci-Fi; and even if you acknowledge the strength of its influence on Everything That Came Afterward; and even if you agree with these points and think favorably of the novel (as I do) you might also find that you'd wished it was more... complex? subtle? nuanced? For all the dramatic tension, there is never any doubt of how things will end. There is never any question--not even from that first chapter--that Paul Atreides will (despite his earliest assertions to the contrary) come to wear the mantle of the Kwisatz Haderach, that he will become the mythical Lisan Al-Gaib. Even when fate is testing him, you can sense that the tragedies are more for your benefit as the reader than they are formative experiences for Paul; there is an armature of a plot with the young hero's arrival, with the tragic events that plummet him into his questing and wandering, and with the climactic reversal that leads to his messianic ascendance. But through all of these trials and tribulations, Paul is always so... confident--there is never a moment's doubt from him. He is a classic Ã¼bermensch--pre-destined to greatness and he knows it and even when he denies it, he is still wrapped up in the mythology that surrounds him. And as a consequence... Paul is almost boring. Constantly tapping into his latent prescience to tell us what will happen next (and being right); constantly getting embroiled in hand-to-hand combat and winning; constantly inspiring the men and women around him to rally to his cause... Even when there is dissent, the dissent is in his favor--the Fremen challenging him to challenge Stilgar for command of the tribes. (And of course, this too ends just as we would predict.)And that is just the bits about Paul--that is not even to attempt to dissect what goes on there w/r/t/ the class system, or women and other issues of gender and sexuality.But... and there's that but again: but it is an enjoyable read and one that is fantastically imaginative and fully-realized. It has earned a lasting place in the science fiction corpus with good reason--and I am actually a little happy that it took me so long to get around to this one.------SEE ALSOâ¢ ""10 Science Fiction Books That I Love (and you will at least like a lot)"" at litreactorâ¢ http://www.flavorwire.com/294548/10-g...â¢ 10 Science Fiction Novels You Pretend to Have Read (And Why You Should Actually Read Them) at io9...more"

I also grant that much of what appears in Dune has become iconic. Seemingly every desert planet in sci fi, not to mention the occasional planet with appreciable precipitation, has giant burrowing worms infesting it, to take just one example. Having said that, though, I didn't read the book in 1965, I read it in 2009, so I'm less interested in what I might have thought had I read it forty years ago than I am in what I did think reading it today.Dune certainly deserves an important spot in the history of the genre, but the copy of the novel I read proclaims itself, via a cover blurb, ""Science fiction's supreme masterpiece"", which is going a bit far. I expect more than ""eh, it got a number of things right, largely by doing them first, and the things it got wrong it got wrong in ways that used to be less tiresome"" from a ""supreme masterpiece"". It's probably worth mentioning here that I'd expect ""Science fiction's supreme masterpiece"" to be more firmly entrenched in the realm of science fiction. Dune is far enough to the ""soft"" side of the science fiction continuum that, like many other works (Star Wars, for example) it can be more fairly characterized as a fantasy where the superpowers are attributed to technology instead of magic.The story is a scrapyard of tired, played out science fiction and fantasy tropes. In short, it's the tale of a deposed royal heir who flees to the wilderness, goes native with the noble savages living therein, learning their survival skills while imparting to them his civilized leadership, and eventually claims his throne, thus fulfilling a prophecy and achieving his special destiny. This all takes place against the background of one of my least favorite lazy stock settings, Feudalism in Space. The protagonist's noble house is uniformly upstanding and heroic, while the antagonist house that ousts them is uniformly evil and treacherous. The ultimate driving factor behind the plot is humanity's ""racial memory"" which somehow ""knows"" that the human race is stagnant and ""wants"" to further its evolution. Ugh.The characters are poorly developed caricatures, particularly the protagonist. Paul-Maud'Dib is less a character than he is a collection of powers and abilities. He has no real weaknesses or character flaws. He's an insurmountable fighter, universally acknowledged as able to defeat any member of the Fremen, who are in turn universally acknowledged to be better than the Emperor's crack Sardaukar, who are universally acknowledged to be better than anyone else. He's also a wise leader, respected by the Fremen, and able to outwit his chief rivals, the Emperor, and the Bene Gesserit. From the age of fifteen, he is already taking charge of his mother, who is not only an adult but a trained Bene Gesserit, with all the mental and physical discipline inherent in that, and defeating Fremen in single combat. He has every superpower that canonically exists, having been not only trained as a Bene Gesserit, but also as a Mentat, not to mention combat training from the very best professional soliders. To top it all off, he is the prophesied Kwizatz Haderach, making him the only man with the genetic memory superpower normally restricted to Bene Gesserit Reverend Mothers. By the age of, I believe, 19 he has displaced the Emperor and sits on the throne. I got a 77 out of a possible 100 by filling in an online Mary Sue test using Paul as a template, and this without knowing whether he and Frank Herbert share any interests (unlikely...I suspect Paul doesn't have any interests beyond reclaiming thrones and developing new powers).Among all the other worn out tropes, I found myself scoffing at the Fremen's role as transparent stand-ins for a Lawrence of Arabia style view of Arab Muslims, noble savages awaiting the civilized leadership whose lack is all that prevents them from rising up and ousting one colonial power in favor of another, ostensibly more enlightened, colonial power. The scoffing rose to the level of actual offense, however, when I reached the scene in which the Fremen Reverend Mother refers to ""our Sunni ancestors"", and realization set in that the Fremen are not merely the clumsy equivalent of Space Muslims, they are literally Space Muslims, in the Space Desert, controlling access to the Critical Space Resource. Further, these Space Muslims aren't even allowed to be Muslims. Rather than anything which might be recognizable as Space Islam, their religion has two identifiable aspects. First, a dream of ecological salvation given to them by a colonial scientist whom they, naturally, accept into their society and revere as a leader. Second, and more offensively, a prophecy artificially grafted onto their culture by the Bene Gesserit that, like something out of the wettest of T.E. Lawrence's wet dreams, predisposes them to give aid and comfort to a colonial who will someday appear to lead them. Again, I realize that 1965 was a different time, hell, Orientalism hadn't even been written yet, but the implications of the treatment of the Fremen in the story are unpleasant to say the least.Overall, I'd give it two giant worms out of a possible five. The plot, while hackneyed, was almost entertaining enough to carry the cardboard characters and it has a number of interesting concepts which are, unfortunately dragged down by the unfortunate implication that colonialism is great, as long as you're from the right colonial power. ...more"

And at the time I wouldnât have known that giant worms and desert adventure was on its way. Iâve read that Herbert reworked the text for novel itself, and perhaps some of what I found tedious in the recent re-read was in the shorter two-part serial that Analog published in December âJanuary, 1963 â â64.

May it be because of the movie in the 80's or the mini series last decade. Both of them don't make any justice to the the book. It's nothing like the Lord Of The Rings movie. (Not that it make you justice of the book but it was a very good movie).This novel as so much to tell that it's difficult to undersdant it all in one read. Maybe in ten years I will return and understant a little more of it. I am not that smart of a person. I like to read but there things that I don't understand. And after reading other reviews or websites I start grasping the full meaning of it. Fortunally most of the book is easy to understand and it makes you think of certain aspects and certain views Frank intented to give. Most important of all in 1965 there were few if any books about environmentalism and ecology. Very interesting view with the almost symbiotic link between the sandworms and the people who live in that world that to perseve the sandworms they must sacrificingsome of their desire for a water-laden planet. It's interesting to see these thing represented 50 years ago because noawadays if we want to perseve some of our natural fauna and flora we must compromise some of our doings...By the way, if by any chance you've missed the book and movie this is a sandworm.The decline of the Roman Empire is also present here with the intrigues within the court with Emperor Shaddam IV, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, The Guild and the Bene Gesserit. They all try to gain the upper hand in the dominion of Arrakis and all of them have their motives.Another influence was the arab references and the Fremen look to me like Berbers but with several differences of course. Some of the words are arabic and the path of Paul that transforms himself from a colonizing House (Country) to a native Fremen look to me like Lawrence of Arabia. But I am not complaining. It was a good transformantion.Another thing and this one I didn't thought until I read somewhere is the importance of Heroes. Now that I think of it they are a bit different from the usual ones. From Wiki Throughout Paul's rise to superhuman status, he follows a plotline common to many stories describing the birth of a hero. He has unfortunate circumstances forced onto him. After a long period of hardship and exile, he confronts and defeats the source of evil in his tale. Eventually, Paul Atreides gains a level of omniscience which allows him to take over the planet and the galaxy, and causing the Fremen of Arrakis to worship him like a god. Author Frank Herbert said in 1979, ""The bottom line of the Dune trilogy is: beware of heroes. Much better rely on your own judgment, and your own mistakes.""And of course religion. Several religions are presented here in one form or another. Most important are Zensumi (mix of Zen Budishm with Shia Islam), Mahayana Christianity mix of Mahayama Budhism and Christianity. It seems that Frank is a adept or fan of Zen Budhism.This book and the ones written afterwards are part of a Universe only compared with Lord of the Ring. There are several writers who in one way or another try to create extensive world like Peter Hamilton, George RR Martin or Steven Erikson but something prevents them to reach that high. Maybe they were the first and that's the way it's going to be until a new writer innovates and creates something truly majestic and epic. I hope I be here to read it.There are other universes that are interesting but they are the making of several dozen or more writers like Forgotten Realms or Warhammer 40k or it's counterpart in Fantasy. Each of these companies have more than 200 books published with three decades of stories and fluff written.. But as I said that's a different story.I am talking here about influences and such but I haven't touch the story of the book. I can resmue in a couple of lines.. Let me try.. House Artreites is now in control of Arrakis (Dune planet) to harvest spice in the name of Emperor and the Guild. This spice is the like our own oil. It controls everything. There are some intrigues and House Harkonnen, rival of Atreides, with the help of the Emperor overthrown the current rulers and kill Leto, the leader of Artreites. Paul, Leto's son and his mother Jessica travel around Dune until they meet the Fremen and become a prophet for the Fremen. With their help they overthrow Harkonnen and the Emperor and rule in his place. Of course it's a short summary and don't make any justice for the book greatness. There are also plots, and counterplots within plots. There are very good teachings that make you wonder and think about. There are so many habits so many information that to resume the novel it would be a gigantic post. And if you want a good resume check wikipedia hereHighly Recommended. If you are only trying once for a Sci-fi book then read this one....more"

It's not just imperial intrigue and battles though. There are so many complex issues to think about on every page; spirituality, religion, philosophy, politics, culture, biology, ecology, technology, sociology and psychology... it's all there and more. But, the use or misuse of power is the overriding theme. Irrakis - Dune - DMy yellow-paged copy of Dune was bought in the mid eighties and I'm kicking myself for only reading it now, thirty years later!This political space opera is EPIC in scale. It's not just imperial intrigue and battles though. There are so many complex issues to think about on every page; spirituality, religion, philosophy, politics, culture, biology, ecology, technology, sociology and psychology... it's all there and more. But, the use or misuse of power is the overriding theme. Irrakis - Dune - Desert Planet is the main setting that gives rise to a legendary prophet that the native Fremen desert tribes have awaited and named Muad'Dib. Paul Atreides is son to Duke Leto Atreides of Caladan whose House is relocated to Irrakis, previous fiefdom of House Harkonnen. Irrakis is barren but has one unique valuable commodity in spice melange. The main obstacle for official sandcrawlers to hunt for and mine spice is sandworms, deadly and fascinating creatures that thrive in this hostile environment, yet the unofficial sandworm riders show true Fremen metal in their secretive rite-of-passage. Spice controls the imperial market. It allows guild pilots to fold space, enabling space travel faster than the speed of light, so the drug is integral for CHOAM directors of the universal development corporation. Importantly, all Houses depend on CHOAM profits. Evil Baron Harkonnen had fattened his literal girth as well as his personal assets during his directorship, and by extension the imperial treasury, by misusing the native tribes and his own men while stockpiling spice. It's obvious to Leto that there will be costly perils for the new Duke of Irrakis. I wish I'd noticed the twenty pages of terminology at the back of the book before reading! Still, I managed to put most things in context without it. The appendices include sections on ecology, religion, and a report on the Bene Gesserit motives and purposes and I'll get around to reading them once my brain has calmed down. Herbert was clearly concerned about environmental issues and I was also intrigued by his gender politics, especially the role of the Bene Gesserit mystic school controlled by the Reverend Mother who is privy to a centuries long female mating index and breeding programme with the goal of producing a super-Mentat (human computer with prescient abilities) female to place on the throne. This is established at the beginning of the book through conversation with Paul's mother, concubine Lady Jessica. Power is patient as well as far-reaching in Herbert's worlds. So many ruthless characters... reminds me of the feuding Starks and Lannisters!I'm brain-fried just thinking about the basic elements of this mammoth epic but in the best possible way. This is one of those books that benefit from a second read after a healthy distance of time. I could see myself rereading this a few years from now and loving it even more. Simply stunning!...more

I'd recommend people read it, but won't start advocating it as a must read.Audiobook: I did the unabridged audio book from Audible. This version had multiple readers. There was the main narrator, and a secondary narrator for all the various excerpts written by Princess Irulan.They also had readers for most of the main characters. Some of the conversations were more like a radio program than a book with the readers conversing with each other as the characters would. The confusing thing to me was sometimes the dialogue used the multiple readers, and sometimes it didn't and was simply read by the main narrator. At first I thought it was maybe for internal dialogue, but that wasn't always the case. I never could figure out the pattern as to why they didn't simply use the multiple readers for every conversation.Full ReviewThis is a book that seems to always finish top 5 in many best of type lists. It's one of my friend's favorites. I got a free audiobook from Audible thanks to the Sword and Laser podcast and I needed a book for my Christmas road trip, so this seemed like a good fit.I really enjoyed all the plotting and politics involved in this book. There was also an interesting array of characters with different backgrounds and desires that often lead to confrontation. This reminds me a lot of Star Trek DS9 or Babylon 5 which I wouldn't be surprised to find were inspired by Dune. Often times the science fiction takes a back seat to the conflict. It's more of a sci-fi setting than a sci-fi story. It shows that even on another planet with strange creatures and technology that greed, honor, war, revenge and many other Human behaviors are really just the same no matter what the setting.If I had any one gripe about the book it was lack of detail in the ending. Everything that has building comes to a head and seems to be over in short order. The ending itself wasn't a disappointment, but I felt like the execution was lacking. This might be what made this book a 4 instead of a 5. It's hard to really say.I may read the second book Dune Messiah since my friend who loves this series said it is really the second half to this book.I've also got the movie coming from Netflix this weekend so I can re-watch it after reading the book. I hope that I'll enjoy it a lot more than I did back in college, now that I have a clue what I'm watching. :)...more
22698731	234225	2008-05-21	5	"Dune definitely deserves a longer review than I can give it here!

Its setting type --a far-future, human-colonized galaxy-- was already a familiar staple of the genre when Herbert wrote this work; but the scale, scope and sheer inventiveness of his world building is in a class by itself, rivaling Tolkien's for complexity. (The book has four appendices that contribute to the back-story, and a glossary --which the reader will use extensively!)This work, though, has more to offer than world-building. At one level, it's a great tale of adventure and action, in a galaxy dominated by a corrupt and exploitative empire with a feudal social structure rife with all the abuses which that can entail. Much of the book's fighting is with edged weapons, and the harsh environment of the desert planet Dune (the unusual ecology of which Herbert works out in detail, with real plausibility) poses life-or-death challenges of its own. Even for this quality alone, this is a gripping read. In some particulars, it resembles Burrough's SF work, and would probably appeal to his fans (of which I'm one). But Herbert's capacity for nuanced, evocative prose and round characterization (even of his villains) is as much head-and shoulders above Burroughs as is his consistent, carefully thought-out world building. On another level, the enmeshing of characters, like Paul and his mother, who are not themselves evil, in a social system that is profoundly so, and in situations and a physical environment that create their own ""brutal necessities,"" gives Herbert opportunities to explore the many fascinating shades of gray that can lend particular interest, moral complexity --and useful moral instruction by example-- to fiction. Finally, this is a novel that definitely deals with serious and important ideas: about human ideas, about society, about philosophy, and about religion. (Herbert's ideas about the latter, which tend to be humanistic and syncretistic, are most clearly presented in an appendix; I don't share them, but that doesn't detract from the the literary value of the novel, from the quality of his stoytelling, or from the degree to which he makes you care about the fate of his major characters.)...more"

The imagery is amazing, the attention to detail enthralling and the characters deep and well-developed. This easily fits into my group of most favorite books. A section of the story that I really enjoyed was the mention of Heisenberg. The reader is engulfed in this alien world and suddenly there is reference to something in recent history. It pulled me out of my reverie as I was reading, jolted me actually. It is during the time that Jessica and Paul have been discovered in the caves by the Fremen and Paul meets Chanti from his dreams. The lines from the story states, ""A kind of Heisenberg indeterminacy intervened..."". This was actually a great comparison to Paul's inability to completely pinpoint time, the fact that his visions flowed from past, present and future, but left him without the capability to exactly pinpoint in which time they were. This coincides with Heisenberg's ""uncertainty principle"" which theorizes that locating a particle in a small region of space makes it impossible to determine the certainty of the velocity of the particle; and conversely, that measuring the velocity of a particle precisely makes the position uncertain. Time can never accurately be measured. I found it rather shrewd that Herbert threw Heisenberg's name in there to begin with as Heisenberg was in the employ of the Nazi's and that in itself is representative of the oppressive similarities between the Fremen and the Jews.This striking bit of intellectuality is just one example of the amazing intelligence behind the writing of this book. This intellect is further emphasized by Herbert's capability to create his novel from articles and ideas written about and visits to the sand dunes of Florence, Oregon where scientists were working on slowing down the growth of these dunes and the feared encroachment into local cities and highways. The brilliant vision of Herbert morphed this real problem into a whole book centered around ecology and the human ability to survive through adaptation and education....more"

El imperio y el Landsraad y la CHOAM y el Gremio de Navegantes ya los hemos visto antes y despuÃ©s, a veces mejor retratados.La gran pregunta que queda hacerse con respecto a Dune es su importancia cultural y su relevancia despuÃ©s de mÃ¡s de 50 aÃ±os de publicada. Muchas novelas ven su legado posterior venido a menos por malas adaptaciones cinematogrÃ¡ficas, como aquÃ­ parece ser el caso. La pelÃ­cula de Lynch, pese a que tiempo despuÃ©s alcanzÃ³ un status de culto, tiene un libreto incomprensible y una pÃ©sima estÃ©tica, por no hablar de los efectos especiales de pacotilla. La adaptaciÃ³n de Sci Fi channel, aunque con mejor libreto, tiene aun peores efectos y aun peor vestuario. Esto parece condenar a Dune o a ser rescatada con una adaptaciÃ³n verdaderamente soberbia, o a quedar como una reliquia de la ciencia ficciÃ³n.Pero hay problemas con la novela misma que me hacen creer que esto no procederÃ¡ fÃ¡cilmente. Uno es claramente la serie de referencias islÃ¡micas en la cultura de los Fremen. Y otro es un retrato aparentemente homofÃ³bico en el personaje del BarÃ³n Harkonnen (caracterizaciÃ³n empeorada por Lynch). Entonces la novela se convierte en algo muy polÃ­ticamente incorrecto para derechas e izquierdas, y quizÃ¡ Ã©se sea el mayor problema.El futuro de Dune se ve asÃ­ sombrÃ­o.

Jessica is loyal, intelligent, and resourceful. She does not hesitate to manipulate events so that they'll lend her son a messiah's authority.As if that weren't enough, Herbert introduces a host of other mentors in Paul's life.Thufir Hawat is the Master of Assassins and a Mentat, so he trains Paul in avoiding assassins as well as analysis. Gurney Halleck is a troubadour, a romantic and a skilled swordsman, a dangerous combination in any SFF novel. Duncan Idaho is the Atreides weapons master, and though he only shows up long enough to drunkenly complain about his lost home, he is pretty deadly because he comes back from the dead as ghola. Last but not least, Paul learns from Stilgar, a fierce Fremen warrior/ zealot that lives for ""the good of the tribe.""Paul can see the past, the present and the future, and he's not bad with a crysknife either. Still, his mentors are actually much cooler than he is, even though (or perhaps because) they are less omnipotent than he is.I can't help wondering if this rule is etched in stone.Dumbledore is cooler than Harry Potter.

It has been described by critics as a âtriumph of the imaginationâ, and is often cited as the best-selling science fiction novel ever to be written. It is set thousands of years in the future, in which mankind now inhabits far-flung regions of the galaxy. The story delves deep in the life of a young boy named Paul Atreides, who being intellectually superior to us in the 21st century, enjoys greater awareness, or a raised consciousness, allowing him to think and feel beyond our current limitations of thought and cognitive capacity; even allowing him prophetic glimpses into the future. He moves with his aristocratic family to a desert planet called Dune at the request of their Emperor. Little does young Paul Atreides know, he is to become far more than a co-inhabitant for the long hunted indigenous people of Dune commonly known as Fremen. He soon discovers that his arrival on the planet was predicted by these long suppressed natives thousands of years ago, and that his purpose there goes far beyond anything he could have possibly imagined. Deeply satisfying; many people go as far as to give this epic novel a somewhat biblical reverence. This is a story of betrayal and liberation, love and the power of integrity, the need for a savior, and the quaint idiosyncrasies that make us human. I would highly recommend Dune to any native reader of the English language. It is engrossing, highly intelligent, awe inspiring, and let it be written on my grave; Literature at its absolute finest!...more

SummaryDuke Leto Atreides of the verdant Caladan uproots his family, Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica and his 15-year-old heir Paul, to the desert planet Arrakis in order to spring a trap set for him by the opposing Baron HarkonneThis novel is a work that you either apparently love or hate. TLDR: I appear to fall in the latter camp. I comprehend Dune's greater contributions to the world of science fiction to be: world-building, the introduction of ecology, and still relevant socio-political allegory. SummaryDuke Leto Atreides of the verdant Caladan uproots his family, Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica and his 15-year-old heir Paul, to the desert planet Arrakis in order to spring a trap set for him by the opposing Baron Harkonnen. Arrakis is a planet which generates an addictive spice (melange, or an allusion to crude oil, if you will) that the space-faring Guild use to navigate safely in space-time. The Bene Gesserit, a socio-political sisterhood of ""witches"" or women who train their bodies to obtain physical and mental powers (including the use of the ""Voice"" on others - controlling individuals with their words), maintain a mythos around the creation of a male Bene Gesserit whom they call the Kwisatz Haderach or, ""the one who can be many places at once."" When the Duke is betrayed and killed, his concubine and son escape into the desert to the native Arrakeen people known as the Fremen, who manage a culture around the preservation and conservation of water (and life). First and foremost, it must be said that the world-building Herbert does is impressive. Now, let's pick apart the allegories because ... while it may have been visionary for its time (1965), it is currently dated. The topics I wish to touch on herein are language and eugenics - though if I want to spend more time on this book (I don't), I'd also address culture, feudalism, mysticism, technology, feminism, predetermination, epigraphs, and trade. That is perhaps why Dune persists, because of the complexity of its allegorical nature. Language Language has power in Herbert's Dune. It is language which distinguishes the mythos of the Bene Gesserit, their Voice powers which physically control individuals and bend said peoples to the will of the ""witch."" The first ""foreign"" words introduced into first few pages are Bene Gesserit, Muad'Dib, gom jabbar, melange and Kwisatz Haderach. The polyglot will note the Arabic, French, and Hebrew herein. Throughout the novel, I was struck again and again by how lazy I thought the language borrowing was ... it felt insulting as a reader to suffer it; why wouldn't the author who spent so much time crafting this world just create his own language for these seemingly alien peoples? (Oh, and it sure as shit bothered me that Jessica and Paul are the only Biblical names in this thing.)Eugenics ...which leads right into the issue of the Fremen, humanity, and the Bene Gesserit cause. There is a distinction made by Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam after Paul's ordeal with the gom jabbar which determines his humanity - the test he passes ""to determine if you're human"" (13). It struck me at the time as interesting because what did it mean to be human in this world; and what did it mean to not be human? From the start, nothing about the description of the Fremen tells you that they are human or humanoid. If anything, Shadout Mapes's description appears more like Dobby in Harry Potter: ""sacklike dress,"" ""prune-wrinkled,"" ""brown,"" and ""blue-on-blue eyes without any white in them"" (109-111). Mapes refers to Paul as ""manling"" while he thinks of her as ""creature."" The Fremen, we later learn, are descendants of the Zensunni wanderers, who sought refuge from the religious persecution at the hands of the Imperial powers (and thus brought Arabic and Buddhism into the story's framework). So this world is populated by humanoid, humanesque sub-human groups? The Fremen (which does look like freemen) are what, sub-human? Herbert never really makes a clear distinction, but the Fremen are regarded by the Imperial power and House Harkonnen as rabble. And Paul as their religious leader Maud'Dib or their tribal member Usul is then what? His superior breeding makes him human - powerful?Dune is dominated by the idea of Bene Gesserit breeding program to produce the male Kwisatz Haderach. First of all, human breeding programs are pretty much synonymous with creepy 19th- and 20th-century eugenics movements ... and the rise of Nazism, racial hygiene, and mass murder. (Before we tsk Europe for that, us Americans should take a good hard look at our own history.) But Herbert attributes this project to a sisterhood of women of science, technology, and learning? Their goal appears to use their own bodies as vessels for a male Bene Gesserit. That's kind of fucked up. I am left wondering what Paul's defiance of the order which bred him means: they have created a monster with the misuse of their knowledge, abilities, and technology. What of Jessica, Chani, Alia, and Irulan in this mess? Are they each strong female characters or are they relegated to retrogressive stereotypes of lover, wife, mother (and daughter)? The work feels reactionary to the emerging women's movement during the 1960s, to increasing technology in everyday life (including reproductive technologies), as a challenge to traditional patriarchal society. In the end, the women who hath wrought the Kwisatz Haderach bring a monster (and future Jihad) into the world. Little sister Alia is an abomination. Herbert's sowing an old story here; Eve is responsible for the fall of Adam. And it pissed me off the entire length of the book....more"

Since then I havenât really been in a rush to get my hands on the source material but hey, itâs on my list of 1000 books and sci-fi is sci-fi and I needed some sci-fi. Besides, the book is always better than the movie. Well, not always, but Iâm pleased to report that this one was. It was certainly more intelligible. It was still weird though.As I understand it Dune was one of the first if not The First to step away from the âred blooded hero goes to another planet, fights green people, saves the (not green) princess, huzzah! The Endâ paradigm of scifi and actually get into some intensive world building. So kudos for that. And there is no denying the Dune world is impressive, spanning planets and incorporating evolved religions, secret societies and political manoeuvrings and all that before we even get to the piece de resistance; Dune itself.Dune is the waterless planet that provides the stage for most of the action of this introductory novel. Evidently this book was inspired by the time Herbert spent with ecological conservators is California. I have no trouble believing this. Living on Dune is such a complicated pain in the ass that it must be based in sound science. The natives wear stillsuits to reclaim and reuse all body moisture (even gross body moisture. Ok, you know what? All body moisture is gross), water is siphoned out of the dead and used as currency and giant worms try to eat you when you move. On to this planet are flung the Atreides family and entourage. They are the goodies and are quickly out-conived by the fat and evil Harkonnen family. Mother and son (Jessica and Paul Atreides) then flee into the planet and play âLaurence of Arabiaâ with the feral Fremen population of Dune until the inevitable showdown (which does not, as the movie would have you believe, demand the presence of Sting in a winged codpiece). Finally the prophecy is fulfilled and the stage is set for a series of books that, as I understand from Wikipedia, quickly crank up the volume to a bat shite crazy 11.That was an oversimplified summary because this is not a simple book. By the time, however, I explain the relationship between the Atreides and the Harkonnen, their relationship to the empire, the perceived and actual strength of the Fremen, the motives behind the Doctorâs betrayal, how the Bene Gesserit fit into this and what the hell a Mentat is I might as well just sit you down and read you the book. Suffice to say there are many moving parts but they run along old themes. Court drama (as in court of the king, not court of law) features heavily, especially at the beginning when everyone is a mess of motives and paranoia. One the paranoid are proved right we move into the afore mentioned âLaurence of Arabiaâ desert messiah paradigm. These staples are well presented.Herbert thinks about his worlds. Heâs the guy who watches Star Trek and wants to know how customs and excise works with transporters and what company is the current leading manufacturer of dilithium crystals. He has considered this universe in minute details and this sort of brainpower really shines when it comes to describing court intrigue. Tribal leaders, local big-men, spies, exiled nobility all have a complete and interacting set of behaviours which, despite being acted out on a distant planet in the far future, still read true. Iâve heard this virtue exalted by fellow readers that try to lure friends and acquaintances into scifi and use Dune as a sort of gateway drug.âOh you should totally read it. Itâs not that science fiction-y. More like the life of the Borgias and it just happens to be set not on this planet.âThere is truth to such statements, but Iâm not convinced this characteristic is a good thing. If I want the Borgias Iâll read about the Borgias. Once Paul The Messiah and Jessica The Mother start Dancing With Fremen in the desert you get a little more exposition on the nature of the planet but most of the focus is on the characters and the prophecy. It is a tall order to borrow a literary device from The Bible and still produce a fresh story, but Herbert does well putting an unique spin on the whole âLaw and the Prophetsâ impetus to the narrative by suggesting such signs and premonitions were planted by secret societies ages ago as insurance. Itâs a compelling idea on which I wish we could have spent more time and this I think is the crux of my problem with Dune.It occurs in an exquisitely crafted universe and even after 500 odd pages there is still so much that has only been hinted at because we spend all our time fussing about with the characters. Itâs not that the characters are bad. They are grandiose and prone to melodrama but that works in a book so prophecy driven. This book has to take itself seriously or no one else would be able to, I understand that, but it still makes the read seem heavy and the characters emotionally needy. Honestly I found the appendixes to be my favourite part of the book and maybe if these had been chopped up and scattered throughout the story it would have helped to breakup some of the existential angst in which everyone seems to revel in writhing. Or maybe not. I donât know. Iâm not an author. Iâm having trouble with this review because I canât get my sense to link up to my sensibility. Logically I really like it. The world is genius, the characters are nuanced little tightasses and the story is complex and exciting. Logically it is straight up my alley and is exactly the sort of thing to trigger my OCD and set me off devouring the rest of the books and trawling google for fanart. Emotionally, I do not correspond and Iâm not sure why. This is all entirely subjective. In fact, I wont even think less of you for disagreeing with me on this point (just this one) but emotionally, Dune weirds me out. I felt similarly about The Golden Compass but pressed on with The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass for the reasons elucidated above. I found that what started as a quirky fantasy story quickly dissolved into a street personâs treatise on how there is no God and how he totally sucks anyway. I was disappointed but felt justified in my initial willies. Dune has set off similar subconscious warning flares. Itâs nothing I can explain, itâs just a sense of âwrongnessâ like the architectural stylings of Cthulu. Paul is just a bit creepy and his future isnât one Iâm interested in hearing about so I donât think Iâll press on with the series. Maybe Iâll get back to it after I finish my 1000 novels. And everything that has and will be written by Alastair Reynolds.Iâm putting neurosis aside though to grade Dune a solid three. It is a super smart and ambitious book. (The epilogues alone earn it at least as much) Iâm glad I read it and I think any discerning connoisseur of the sci-fi genre should do the same if only out of respect for a founding father. Beyond that itâs your call....more

Dune is the greatest work of science fiction ever written, full stop, and one of the most influential books in my own personal canon. Reading Dune was a watershed moment in my adolescence. I've read two copies (and Children of Dune) into pieces, my first literary writing was a Dune pastiche. This book has marked me. But you shouldn't just take my word for it.******EXPANDED REVIEW FOR THE HUGO AWARD PROJECT******Dune is a densely imagined masterpiece, a book of immense scope and terrible purpose set in a universe of politics, religion, ecology, and myth. Approximately 10,000 years in the future, mankind has spread through the stars under the aegis of the Emperor, propelled by the starships of Spacing Guild, and ruled by innumerable feudal great houses. The most precious commodity in the universe is the spice melange, a powerful drug which extends life, opens the mind, and is the lifeblood of safe faster-than-light navigation. The spice comes from only one place: Arrakis, Dune, desert planet. A harsh world inhabited by harsh people. Two of the great feudal houses that rule human space are swapping control of Dune. The honorable Atreides and the vile Harkonnen are mortal enemies locked in an ancient and generations long feud. Harkonnen is abandoning the immense profits of Arrakis to the Atreides by order of the Emperor, but it is obvious to all that the swap is a trap. What is not obvious are the ramifications for humanity that will come of this action.The story begins with young Paul Atreides, heir to House Atreides, asleep, being observed by his mother and an old witch. There is the potential that he is the Kwisatz Haderach, a super-man. He is tested with terrible pain; survives, and in the first third of the book we meet his world through the course of his life. Paul is subjected to intensive training in martial arts, physical control, and mental computation. Dune is described: a geography made of sand and bare rock, survival only through exotic technology like stillsuits that recapture and purify the body's water. The shape of the political struggle begin to emerge, and the war of assassins between the great houses. We meet the Fremen, the native people of Dune, and there is just a hint that House Atreides might accomplish great things before the jaws of the trap close. The Harkonnens, with the convert support of the Emperor, invade. Duke Leto Atreides is killed, and Paul and his mother are forced to flee the to the Fremen.The second and third parts of the book are concerned with Paul learning the Fremen culture, fulfilling his destiny as the Kwisatz Haderach, and finally achieving vengeance against the Harkonnens and the Emperor. The Fremen are one of the most original cultures present so far. They're clearly inspired by Bedouins, follow Zensunni religious beliefs, and sprinkle their language with Arabic words, but this is more than Lawrence of Arabia in Space (and yes, I've read Seven Pillars of Wisdom). Paul's exploration of inner space and his burgeoning powers of prescience under the influence of drugs is for me the most interesting part of the book, with the philosophical message that the known path leads always into stagnation and death, and its depictions of a man caught between a terrible destiny (visions of a galactic jihad under Atreides flags) and his inability to halt it. And the final confrontation with the Baron Harkonnen and the Emperor and all the forces that have lead Paul Atreides to this nexus of power, are as satisfying and climatic as any scenes in fiction.It is impossible for me to be objective about Dune. I've read two paperback copies of Dune (and one of Children of Dune) into pieces. Having read the 12 prior Hugo winners, I have a little more context on what makes Dune unique. This is the first of the novels with a galaxy-spanning empire based on non-democratic/meritocratic principles. It has by far best depictions of a protagonist culture truly alien to mid-American sensibilities in the Fremen, as well as the best developed planetary ecology (although there are some hints of that in A Case of Conscience. Dune is the first novel in this series that could (and did) support a whole cohesive setting, matched only by The Lord of the Rings in the fiction of the time. The psychotropic exploration of the inner self is written by someone who's actually done drugs, as opposed to have the sensation of altered states described to them. And above all, Dune has the best female characters so far in the Lady Jessica, Chani, and the epigraphs by Princess Irulan that begin each chapter. Dune is Paul's story, but the women in it are just as important and well-rounded as the men. And I love the tense perfection of some of the smaller scenes as well: The Arrakeen dinner party and it's hidden politics; the death of the Planetologist Liet-Kynes in the desert; Paul and Jessica retrieving their survival gear from a sandslide using foam. Trying to read this with a more critical eye, there are some bits that don't work perfectly. The knife-fights are clunkier than I remember (somebody leaps only the to meet the blurring point of a blade on their chest two or three times), which is unfortunate given how important they are. Herbert has a grand authorial voice, but it renders all the characters a little similar. The only gay character is arch-villain Baron Harkonnen, although I think it's clear that his evil is defined by his pedophilia, sadism, and gluttony, rather than any sexual preference for men over women. The actual politics of the universe are smaller than I remember. Atreides, Harkonnen, and Corrino on Caladan, Arrakis, and Geidi Prime, although as in a play there is a sense of a bigger cast and other sets waiting in the wings. In terms of the themes of human potential and the wisdom of government over centuries, the only fair comparison to Dune from this project are Stranger in a Strange Land and A Canticle for Liebowitz, and Dune blows them out of the water. If any of the setting elements or stylistic tricks of Dune seem like cliches, it's because the past 50 years of science fiction have borrowed from the original so liberally. Dune is a monument to human imagination....more

The other factThis book was complete mix bag for me due to the fact that although I enjoyed the story and the background in which it was conducted, but some of the terms went complete bouncer for me, take for example the the Bene Gesserit although their motive was clear to me but their powers sometimes seemed too much mystical for me to understand. Also the author narrates the story from what a particular character is thinking at a particular time, and after a time it starts becoming confusing. The other fact was the protagonist of the plot always goes into selfie mode where in he starts contemplating the destruction of universe by him, it becomes too much tiresome after a point of time.Also Herbert has created a cult like mystery with the religion practiced by fremen due to which it becomes very much hard to understand their religious direction. Also he keeps using lot of Arabic words and their meaning is completely lost to me as I don't understand Arabic. Also the theory by which Kynes is trying to change the ecology of the planet from desert to lush green was another bouncer for me.Although Herbert has given a huge appendix of 80 pages at the end of the book but it was too little and too late for me to give it a chance.Well now the bitterness is out of me let's get back to the things which I loved about the story. The story basically begins with our protagonist paul undergoing a test in order to prove that he is human. His mother consoles him with Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.Also paul asks why is this test being carried out and reader gets the answer as Why do you test for humans?â he asked. âTo set you free.â âFree?â âOnce, men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.â ââThou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a manâs mind,ââ Paul quoted.Our protagonist is shown as a very curious child from the fact that once he comes to know that they are migrating to Arrakis he starts reading and getting to know his new home. He comes to know that When you live upon Arrakis,â she had said, âkhala, the land is empty. The moons will be your friends, the sun your enemy.Once paul lands on Arrakis along with his family, he quickly realizes here water is the money,Those minds,â he said. âThey look at those trees and they think: âThere are one hundred of us.â Thatâs what they think.â She turned a puzzled frown on him. âWhy?â âThose are date palms,â he said. âOne date palm requires forty liters of water a day. A man requires but eight liters. A palm, then, equals five men. There are twenty palms out thereâone hundred men.Duke Leto knows that the harkkonens are not going to give up such a important place i.e. Arrakis to them easily,Paul!â The Duke frowned at his son. âKnowing where the trap isâthatâs the first step in evading it. This is like single combat, Son, only on a larger scaleâa feint within a feint within a feintâ¦seemingly without end. The task is to unravel it.He knows that the spice available on Arrakis drives the economy of the empire.âWho else would be so sure on the sand? Who else might be left out of your worries as a matter of courseâbecause they are in no danger? They know how to live here!.What Leto plans is that to win the trust of fremen of Arrakis and create an army of them.Arrakis's threat is not only its hot climate but also the mining of spice has many dangers attached to it with the worms attacking the machine which mines the spice, but Leto wins the trust of ecologist Kynes when he shows that he cares for his men more than for the spice.âThis Duke was concerned more over the men than he was over the spice. He risked his own life and that of his son to save the men. He passed off the loss of a spice crawler with a gesture. The threat to menâs lives had him in a rage. A leader such as that would command fanatic loyalty. He would be difficult to defeat.As the duke fears he gets betrayed, but his concubine Jessica and his son Paul manage to escape from the clutches of harkkonens.Paul goes into a shell upon losing his father,Moodâs a thing for cattle or for making love. You fight when the necessity arises, no matter your mood.â Perhaps thatâs it, Paul thought. Iâll mourn my father laterâ¦when thereâs time.They manage to find shelter in the company fremen, and Paul is already thinking of killing Harkkonens,The place to hit them is in the spice,â Paul said. How can he think of attack at a time like this? she asked herself. âAn entire planet full of spice,â she said. âHow can you hit them there?â She heard him stirring, the sound of their pack being dragged across the tent floor. âIt was sea power and air power on Caladan,â he said. âHere, itâs desert power. The Fremen are the key.âPaul starts getting all kinds of visions about the future once he tastes the spice,Can you remember your first taste of spice?â âIt tasted like cinnamon.â âBut never twice the same,â he said. âItâs like lifeâit presents a different face each time you take it. Some hold that the spice produces a learned-flavor reaction. The body, learning a thing is good for it, interprets the flavor as pleasurableâslightly euphoric. And, like life, never to be truly synthesized.He becomes one of reverend among the fremen and his mother becomes a crone. Will Paul overthrow the Harkkonen ruler on Arrakis? well for that I guess you will have to read the book. But the last fight between the empire and the fremen was good reading for me. I will definitely read the rest of dune series after this, but my only hope is that the mysticism surrounding the fremen starts unraveling itself in the coming books.I give this book 3/5 stars....more

The financial rewards of control""He who controls the spice controls the universe""Duke Leto Atreides has been ordered by the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV, to give up his comfortable home planet of Caladan and take over the administration of the almost barren planet Arrakis, whose vast sandy deserts give it its other name â Dune. Harsh though the environment of Dune may be, it is the only planet in the Empire which can produce melange, the spice drug, which extends the life of those who use it. The financial rewards of controlling Dune are immense, so the previous rulers, the Harkonnens, don't intend to give up their claim, and it appears the Emperor may be secretly supporting the Harkonnens in their campaign to destroy Duke Leto. But Duke Leto has a son, Paul, the offspring of Duke Leto's concubine, Lady Jessica of the Bene Gesserit sisterhood. Paul is the result of generations of selective breeding, carefully controlled by the Bene Gesserit to produce the Kwizatz Haderach, a male Bene Gesserit with unprecedented mental powers, including the ability to see possible futures. And the spice drug melange is a crucial part of the process of bringing those powers to their full potential...Written in 1965, Dune was the first real fantasy saga set on other worlds, and has remained in the fantasy/sci-fi bestseller lists ever since. It's often compared to The Lord of the Rings for the completeness of its world-building, but the tone of it is much more ambiguous â the dividing lines between good and evil aren't quite so clearly drawn. It's a grappling for power and control, set in a society that has aspects of the mediaeval â lordly families wielding ultimate power over their peoples, where marriages are made for political advantage rather than love, and where torture and death are accepted as the norm.The ecological themes in Dune reflect the beginnings of the anxieties over our own earth environment, which was just starting to become a matter of public concern in the '60s. The importance of water on this desert planet is brilliantly portrayed, as Herbert shows how its scarcity has led to it becoming part of the mythology and even religion of the planet's inhabitants. Everything revolves round water and customs reflect that â from water being the major currency to the ritual recovery of water from the bodies of the dead. The Fremen inhabitants of the planet are trying to make their planet more habitable by careful use and cultivation of what they already have, but Herbert, who had an interest in ecology in his real life, shows how changing one aspect of an environment must be carefully controlled to prevent the destruction of others. Much of the language of Dune is based on real-life Arabic languages â there is much talk of jihad, for example, and many of the names are Arabic in origin. I suspect this, combined with the desert landscape, might make the modern reader read things into the story that probably weren't intended and certainly weren't obvious to this reader when I first read the book sometime in the '70s or '80s. Our familiarity with the Middle East is so much greater now than it was then. However it's fun to draw comparisons between spice and oil, and to see the struggle between the Fremen and their imperial overlords as a reflection of the wars of the last few decades. But in truth, the reader can only go so far down this route before the comparison begins to fall apart.The place of women in the Dune universe is not exactly a feminist's delight, and seems pretty backwards looking even for the '60s. Primarily breeding machines, even the Bene Gesserit wield their power through marriage and concubinage (yes, concubines!) and it's a bit sad that their most urgent desire is to create a male, and therefore superior, Bene Gesserit. Often called witches by the men, and mistresses of the wierding ways, the Bene Gesserit nevertheless are feared and sometimes respected, so women do play an important, if not exactly heroic, role in the stories. And despite their inferior position in society, Herbert has created some memorable female characters, not least the Lady Jessica herself who gradually develops into something much more complex than simply the mother of the Kwizatz Haderach. Have I made this book sound impossibly boring? I hope not, because after a fairly slow start when the characters and worlds are introduced, there's plenty of action. Treachery, intrigue, poisonings and battles, a little bit of romance, but not too much, the truly nasty Baron Harkonnen and his evil henchmen, and most of all Paul-Muad'dib and the heroic Fremen all make for a great adventure story. And the giant worms, the makers, are one of the all-time great creations of fantasy. Their role in the ecology of the planet and the way they are viewed by the Fremen, as something to be worshipped, feared and yet used, makes them central to the book. They are a force of nature that man, with all his technology, can't defeat â indeed, mustn't defeat, because without the worms Dune would lose the thing that gives it is unique importance. And they are terrifying in their destructive power, made worse somehow by the fact that they are driven by no intelligent purpose.There are several sequels to Dune, and while this one doesn't quite end on a cliffhanger, the reader is left knowing there is much more to come. From memory the first couple of sequels are excellent, after which the series began to lose its edge somewhat â for me, at least. But I'm looking forward to re-reading the next one, Dune Messiah, in the not-too-distant future, and meantime would highly recommend Dune not just as an excellent read in itself, but as the book that has inspired so many of the later fantasy writers.www.fictionfanblog.wordpress.com...more"

I have to admit that it wasn't one of the smart decisions of my life. But seeing as how that invisible nonessential wall had been removed from my life, âBetter late than never,â I thought.Frank Herbert offers a lot to readers of science fiction. One can easily say that Dune, alongside Asimovâs Foundation, has had quite a powerful influence on modern Science Fiction. But the similarities of Dune and Foundation is limited to the presence of an Empire, which I guess was a common trope back then, and complex politics. Otherwise, the differences are divergent. For one example, concepts of âthe messiahâ and âthe prophecyâ drive Herbertâs story. The world of Dune is heavily based on our early Middle Eastern and European cultures. Evidently, planets are ruled by Great Houses, which all follow the leadership of the said Empire. Where there are Great Houses and an Empire -- and an epic story involved -- there must be a power struggle of sort. At the center of it is the Planet Arrakis. This planet is the only source of the special spice âmelangeâ -- a very important and empowering drug in the fictional universe. âHe who controls the spice, controls the universe.âThere is not much point in delving into the story or the factions. It unfolds at its own pace, and will inform the reader of everything s/he needs to know. Besides, anything I say can and may be a spoiler. But I will risk saying this: Duneâs influence is very apparent in modern science fiction and fantasy roleplaying video games. The epic sci-fi space opera film trilogy, Star Wars itself draws influence from Dune.Arrakis itself is a fascinating concept. The desert planet is one of the harshest places in the universe. Scarcity of water in the desert, the primitive lives of the Fremen (native spice addict humans), the dazing heat, constant sandstorms, and of course, the nightmarish Sandworms make it the most difficult planet to live on. But being the only place where the spice can be found, Arrakis is important. So it is pretty obvious how the planet comes to the center of the drama.The prose is fantastic. Herbert seems to have a nice assortment of grammar and knows how to properly use them to achieve an amazing effect. It would be unfair to compare him to Gibson -- who is terse as hell, but happens to be extremely satisfactory â or Conrad -- who knows exactly what to write to leave the reader awed, writhing and breathing heavily on the floor -- but he doesnât waste words. Just right amount of word building occurs -- telling us what we need to know, and leaving the rest to our imagination -- and it never gets in the way of the narrative. The pacing is excellent. Within 600 pages, so many events occur, and that at just the right pace, that it puts most modern epic fantasy doorstoppers to shame. One shouldnât judge the author from a book of his, but Iâll just let out a little opinion. Herbert could have made a trilogy, or maybe even an epic series out of the first book alone. But Iâm glad he did not, and âeternal gratitude of mine, heâll haveâ.I donât want to say anything about the story. Everything in the description about âcomplex, multi-layered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion as the forces of the empire confront each other for control of Arrakisâ is true. The characters are amazing, their problems are bound to make you emotional, and their struggle for power and survival is mind-numbing. âThis is like single combat, Son, only on a larger scale â a feint within a feint within a feint... seemingly without end.âOf course, I cannot say that the book is perfect. One annoying aspect of the book is how the author changes perspectives after every few paragraphs. The transition is a little uncomfortable and sometimes, it gives away what a character is thinking. Some, but by no means all, story build-ups are very weak, because they are quickly dissolved when the thoughts of certain characters are revealed.What makes things worse is that every chapter begins with a little excerpt from a history book. Most of the time, this adds some background information and offers transition between the chapters in few words, which in other cases would have been drawn into boring sequences. But sometime, the author uses it to explain some extremely interesting event in a very non-dramatic way. Not to say that Iâm a great authority on this matter, but having fifty more pages with these events would have been so much better. Asimov does this too, but his are more like a vague indication of what might occur in the chapter. (view spoiler)[ The character development of the major âgoodâ (and I say âgoodâ because thereâs no absolute good character) characters are great, but the major âevilâ characters' developments eventually build up to very little, which made me question why it was even there.  (hide spoiler)]In life, very few things are perfect. The best science fiction stories do often have flaws in them. Whatever the cause may be, Dune has a lot to offer. If the reader compares, the flaws are quite easily overshadowed by the joys of this gem. For a long time, Dune stood unparalleled in the world of science fiction. To speak frankly, Duneâs sequels have more flaws than the first, but this is a review for the first book. Dune can be considered as a standalone book with equal reverence as it can be as the first step in the series. So should Dune be read? Without a doubt. And let's not forget that at the time of release, Dune reinvented science fiction....more

It won the Hugo Award in 1966 and the Nebula Award in 1965. After writing the book Herbert has submitted the novel to over twenty publishers and it is rejected by all of them. The book is finally published by Chilton Books.Thousands of year later countless planets are inhabited by humans and ruled by an Emperor. Despite settling countless planets humans are using a low level technology. About ten thousand years ago intelligent robots and computers with great artificial intelligence take control of everything and enslaved all humanity.In the beginning of the book House Atreides is appointed to govern the desert planet Arrakis which was the opposite of their water planet Caladan. And the story goes on the desert planet Arrakis.There was an old dispute with House Atreides and House Harkonnen who are also the previous governors of the Arrakis. Baron Vladimir, the head of the House Harkonnen, wants to rule the Arrakis because of the spice. Spice is very important in Dune universe, most of the technology is based on the spice. For example the navigators are using spice, the mÃ©lange, to find the routes.After the House Atreides moved to the Arrakis, Vladimir kills the Leto Atreides who is the head of House Atreides. Despite everybody thinks, Letoâs concubine Jessica and son Paul has also been killed, they have survived thanks to Liet-Kynes and Wellington Yueh who is tragically betrayed the family.Two years later Paul MuadâDip strikes with his Fremen friends. In these two years, Paul has transformed into a leader and has some superhuman powers. Fremenâs are call him as the prophet and the Bene Gesserit society is calling him Kwisatz Haderach. One of the important part of this books is the characterization. Even the minor characters are very detailed, and you can feel their presence. You can easily feel the differences between the characters. Main character of the book is Paul Atreides. At the start of the book Paul is portrayed as the child of the House Atreides and during the 2 years of time he is slowly, actually very quickly, to a hero or something like messiah. While reading his transformation, I notice that I like messiah like characters who has transformed into something different and who has god-like abilities. Paul has become the leader of the Fremen, he has wed with one of them, he has organized the Fremen to jihad and finally he has been successful on taking the revenge of his father from the Harkonnens and the Emperor. He is also very intelligent on taking the decisions.Paulâs mother, Lady Jessica is also one of the main characters. During Paulâs awakening Paul reveals Jessica was the daughter of the Vladimir Harkonnen, and due to this Kwisatz Haderach has come to the universe one generation earlier.Gurney Halleck and Duncan Idaho are sword masters of the House Atreides and they have an important role on Paulâs ability on fight.The author wants us to hate Harkonnens and probably you will hate all of the Harkonnens especially from Vladimir and Feyd-Rautha.Princess Irulan seems to be the narrator but we could not see her until the end of the book when Paul made the marriage agreement. We are reading the whole book from Irulanâs notes.There are many themes in the book. Religion, environment, ecology, secret organizations and politics. In this book we can see the dark and the light side. Atreidesâ are mostly described as the good ones, and the others mostly Harkonnens and to some degree the Emperor are described as the bad guys. Also born of a hero motif is used. At the first part Paul tried to prevent the Jihad but at some point he could not stop and use the jihad to destroy the bad guys.I like Frank Herbertâs style. First of all the whole story and setting is great and Herbert used a perfect style to tell his story.Years ago Iâve read House Atreides which is written by Frank Herbertâs son Brian. I could not remember the details but remember Iâve really liked the general concept and the world. I remember the Atreides probably the event when Jessicaâs mother get pregnant by Vladimir and a slave boy, probably Duncan Idaho, is running all the time.Plot 10/10Characterization 9/10Style 9/10Setting 10/10Entertainment 9/10Overall: 4.7/5Iâve started listening the Dune in 2nd of January and finished it on 21st of January. It is really a long but exciting book. I highly recommend this book to anyone who like science-fiction. Even if you do not like science-fiction you can give it a try....more

I had forgotten quite a lot about this book -- honestly, the bits of knowledge I'd retained were mostly Arakeen vocabulary necessary to make dumb jokes with Yglesias over whiskey (which is the top priority, to be clear).I'm not sure that Dune is a good novel. How much plot tension can there really be once your messiah protagonist gains the ability to see the future? The relentless strength of the Fremen, Paul's alienness and the shrug with which the unavoidability of galactic jihad is eventually dispensed all rob this book of tension.But it's strangely complete -- amazingly so. The collision between 60s psychedelia and Middle Eastern petrocolonialism are easy to pick out, but the layers of detail that accrete, from the Landsraad to the Beutlerian Jihad to the Spacer Guild all provide a cohesion and depth that is not only rarely achieved in sci-fi, but which almost never takes such original forms. Then, even more impressively, the culture of Arrakis is unveiled as an even deeper well of detail. It's very, very impressive.Two things stuck out for me on this rereading that hadn't before:- The drugginess. This one is obvious, I guess, but for whatever reason it didn't make as much of an impression on me the first time through. Naturally there's the spice. But there's also Thufir Hawat's uppers, Feyd Rautha's sword-born soporific, and a vast array of poisons. The potential for chemicals to unlock human (and trans-human!) potential is treated very, very seriously. Before this reading I didn't realize that this attitude must have existed in culture of Herbert's time. But it's interesting to remember the zeitgeist during the novel's creation. Despite embarrassed efforts to retcon it into performance art, a considerable amount of psychedelic drug culture was concerned with the potential for genuine human transcendence.- The sexual politics are worse than I would've thought. This one is also probably pretty obvious, but I don't think I did a very good job of reading for it until a few years ago. The book's only gay character is the Baron Harkonnen. And while it's interesting to see that his orientation is seemingly unremarkable within Dune's universe, it's hard to avoid the fact that he's also one of the grossest, most evil characters in that universe. One suspects that Herbert made him gay in part to add to his villainy. Second, there's the Bene Gesserit, aka basically all of the female characters in the book. It's great that they're all badasses (award 50 Whedon points). But they're also a secret, galactically large feminine conspiracy to manipulate men and steal their precious bodily fluids. And their mysticism is rendered somewhat pathetic by the necessary maleness of the kwisatz haderach. By the end of the book both Jessica and the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohian are cowering before Paul, who is angrily explaining how fed up he is with their secret lady club. Not great.Perhaps the most interesting question for me is what Herbert made of religion and prophecy. He makes it clear that aspects of the prophecy within which Paul operates are artificial -- cynically implanted by the Bene Gesserit Missionaria Protectiva. The book's appendices also reveal much of the BG religion to be arguably synthetic, a product of deliberately organized unitarian commissions. And yet the revelations are real, the prophecies accurate! Herbert's mysticism is deep enough to not only ignore disproof, but to embrace it and insist on disproving it in turn: the false origins of the Lisan al Gaib prophecy are revealed, embraced and then transmuted, just like the Water of Life. It's a strange, druggy, grandiose dream, and it's astounding that Herbert could get it all down on paper....more

""Dune"" really wasn't all that good.Saying this, it's very easy to see why ""Dune"" is spoken about as the pinnacle of sci-fi achievement or as -the- sci-fi masterpiece. Herbert has a distinct style and ideas that are both thick and well-structured. His world is developed to a detailed and pristine degree and all of it seems flawlessly interconnected. Never did I feel like something was out of place or find that parts didn't compliment one another. In world-building, Herbert came up with something both believable and at the same time fantastic.The problem with this is his execution. Herbert has terrible diction (not as bad as Clarke, but still not great) and his prose is lengthy and boring. Normally I enjoy authors who take the time to describe setting and detail, but Herbert's was dry and unimaginative. Further, Herbert switches character POV too frequently and without enough warning. This seemed at first necessary as what Herbert was trying to do was (I think) show the various thoughts and ideas that were running through each of the character's minds to add to the stress and fear of delicate politics, but generally it read jumbled and confused. Also, even though I knew what everyone was thinking at (almost) every moment, I didn't feel that the characters were well developed, with the exception of Jessica. My largest problem with the book concerns its plot so: SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!Herbert's set-up is great but his plot is terrible. The problem, perhaps, is that we know too much. From the beginning we know that Yueh is the traitor and even though some characters (Halleck and Hawat) suspect Jessica, they come to realize their mistake without drama or interest. ""Dune""'s climax builds slowly and then suddenly leaps out, seemingly from nowhere, and confusingly comes to its height when the Baron is suddenly killed off. Then all the remaining bad-guys are paraded before Paul who cleans up their plot nicely and cleanly one at a time. It felt as if Herbert, all of a sudden, had to stop writing and swept the plot away as quickly as possible. In the end ""Dune"" was strangely too straight-forward, describing characters who are suspecting everything and everyone around them but aren't developed and executed well enough by the plot.Finally, there is something truly terrifying about the Bene Gesserit and I don't mean their ""illuminati"" quality. At the end we come to realize that they've been trying to manipulate the genes of the highest classes of society so that they can create the Kwisatz Haderach, a man who can go further than anyone else into the mysteries of the universe. But this assumes that someone's genetic makeup is what allows them to enter into religious/spiritual experiences, and that only a certain person with just the right genes can achieve this depth. What a terrifying way to think; I've read few things more dehumanizing.So ""Dune?"" Well, I finished it. I got through it after trying for, what, fifteen years? But I won't continue reading the series, nor would I suggest it to a friend. It was great potential but, when Herbert's ideas got to paper, they just puffed out and died. ...more"

That was my first exposure to Frank Herbertâs work and it took me a very long time to get around to reading the actual book.At this point, I think everyone know this is a messianic story, with a pretty classic layout. A prophecy foretold the arrival of a warrior-leader on the desert planet of Arrakis, who would free itâs people and turn the planet into a paradise where no one would ever want for water again. In parallel, the Emperor gives control of the planet to House Atreide: itâs the most valuable planet in the universe, as it is the only source of the precious spice, necessary to space travel: but it is also a white elephant, as it is hostile and House Harkonnen, the devious former rulers, will stop at nothing to get it back. You can already see how that will unfold. The strength of this book is not in the element of surprise, it is in the mind-blowing world-building and characterization. The details of the social structure, history, customs, religion and politics in âDuneâ make it feel incredibly real as your turn the pages. Having seen the series before reading the book, I pictured everyone dressed in elaborate, geometrical costumes and headdresses; I saw monumental architecture with bright colours.But what I loved the most about âDuneâ is that it is the deconstruction of a messiah. How does it feel to be the person legend has predicted for generations, anxiously anticipated by the oppressed, who will blindly follow you anywhere because they fanatically believe that you will save them? Knowing many will die to fulfil the prophecies and that this blood will ultimately be on your hand, seeing small events and knowing they will one day be told as grandiose moments that had very little to do with what actually happened. That canât be a comfortable hat to wear and I felt for Paul. I also felt for Jessica, who watched her son transform into something she could have hardly imagined when she decided to disobey the orders of the Bene Gesserit and provide her lover with a son and heir instead of a daughter.This brings me to how fascinated I was with the amount of control the Bene Gesserit held over the various legends and folk tales, with their Missionaria Protectiva and their breeding program. I wanted to know all about it, read their histories and plans! I think it a very successful world-building when I wish I could live in it and go to the local library to read about it!That being said, the dryness of the writing was a bit of a turn-off. I was so annoyed every time Hebert felt the need to write âAahhâ or âHumâ mid-dialogue, to show me the person speaking was hesitating. I feel like he could have been more evocative without resorting to this weird addition to conversation. I could have also used more lush descriptions, to cement his world in my brain and make it even more alive.

Un seÃ±or con barba que suscribe que el lenguaje limita o configura el pensamiento y que el liderazgo se sirve de la mentalidad de esclavo del ser humano. Este barbudo se dedica a pensar en las consecuencias de la evoluciÃ³n, la eugenesia, la religiÃ³n y la ecologÃ­a. Y este seÃ±or que suele llevar el pantalÃ³n subido hasta los sobacos escribe un libro en el que junta todo esto. Y resulta que ese libro es legible, es entretenido, puede pasar por novela de ciencia ficciÃ³n heroica o la puedes leer como ensayo polÃ­tico. Â¿Hace falta mÃ¡s para convencernos de leerla?Como sinopsis, esta novela nos cuenta la historia de un mesÃ­as en un planeta hostil. Un planeta desÃ©rtico poblado de gusanos grandes como petroleros en el que un montÃ³n de facciones estelares se disputan la explotaciÃ³n de una sustancia, una droga potenciadora de la conciencia, que crece Ãºnicamente en este planeta.El universo de Dune carece de ordenadores e inteligencias mecÃ¡nicas. Es un universo que se ha servido de la eugenesia y de drogas estimulantes de la conciencia para evolucionar mental y fÃ­sicamente. TambiÃ©n un universo donde prima la religiÃ³n y el liderazgo teocrÃ¡tico sobre cualquier idea occidental de democracia. Lo mÃ¡s parecido a un estado popular es el absolutismo ilustrado de una de las facciones.Y en este universo sucede esta historia. En un in media res cÃ³smico que te deja con hambre, pero que es factible leer aisladamente. Y no hace falta leer ningÃºn libro mÃ¡s de la saga. El resto de libros, estando bien, pueden defraudar si buscas mÃ¡s filosofÃ­a de Dune. Son otras novelas, ambientadas en el mismo universo. Pero toda la carga alegÃ³rica se gasta en esta entrega.Lo Ãºnico que puede incomodar a un lector despistado es la artificiosidad de las conversaciones, el exceso de pensamiento que sucede cada vez que alguien abre la boca. Pero, teniendo en cuenta el bagaje del universo, tiene sentido y es parte fundamental de la ambientaciÃ³n.TambiÃ©n nos puede parecer que Frank defiende la idea yihadista, que contrapone la idea de Occidente y Oriente Medio como expoliadores y expoliados defendiendo a estos Ãºltimos. Aunque, viendo el historial de Frank y las novelas posteriores, parece que no se muestra partidario del liderazgo deshumanizado y fanÃ¡tico yihadista/fascista/religioso y tampoco del colonialismo esclavista destructor del medio ambiente.En definitiva una novela brutalmente alegÃ³rica que podemos leer en mÃºltiples niveles y quedarnos en el que mÃ¡s cÃ³modo nos sea. Y recomendable para los que gustan de novela histÃ³rica o ciencia ficciÃ³n. ...more

The rest of the book was good, but it wasn't all I had hoped for. Yes, Frank Herbert was a good science fiction writer. Yes, he was excellent at building this world of Arrakis and the universe around it. And yes, this is by far better writing than the Dune prequels written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson.In spite of all that, Dune wasn't all I hoped it would be. The expositionHad it not been for that concluding chapter, this book would've earned three stars. But that was quite a finale. The rest of the book was good, but it wasn't all I had hoped for. Yes, Frank Herbert was a good science fiction writer. Yes, he was excellent at building this world of Arrakis and the universe around it. And yes, this is by far better writing than the Dune prequels written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson.In spite of all that, Dune wasn't all I hoped it would be. The exposition drags too often, repeating the same tired phrases. Some of the characters are interesting in ways, but they also lack any semblance of real people with emotions or ability to change. Primarily, however, I was bothered by the lack of originality in the culture: the feudalism, the mysticism, the religionâall of these are a grab bag of earth history. I mean this is supposed to be like 22000 years in the future, right? Let's throw the comma in there, make it more clear: 22,000. Look back at the last 2,000 years of earth history, all that has changed. And in the next 20,000 years we're going to have dukes, and sword fights, and Catholicism, and the silencing of women spread across the galaxy? Maybe we should blow up this planet before it's too late.Despite his lack of originality in areas, Herbert made up for it in other way. For the time, a period when sci-fi was dominated by green martians capturing earth's women with ray-guns, Dune was clearly something different. Modern science-fiction clearly emulates much from the world Herbert built in Dune. Herbert created a wonderfully complex world with the sandworms and the freman, the guild and so forth. And, he not only created a very intricate story here, but he was able to sustain it to the end.So, overall, I felt Dune was a very middle of the road kind of novel. Not great. Not horrible. But all that story Herbert built up really does conclude in a dramatic fashion, and it is for this reason alone I have to give the novel a little more credit. It leaves me wondering what Herbert did in the following novels in the series, but I'll find that out once I get there. I do plan on reading on in the series if only out of curiosity.Unfortunately, Herbert used the word âpresentlyâ on every other page, a pet peeve of mine. That alone may deter me from reading the whole series, but we'll see how much I can take. And if someone can please explain to me the use of the word presently, I would appreciate it. (For other authors who overuse the word âpresentlyâ see Shute, Nevil.)...more

The AtreiDune by Frank Herbert is kind of an oddity. It's mostly science fiction given how it's set on a distant planet and got space ships and lasers and all that stuff. But it's also got a few of the tropes of the fantasy genre --people fight with blades, a feudal system with noble houses, prophecies, and stuff that looks suspiciously like magic. But whatever you call it, Dune is pretty good.The book follows the noble House Atreides, specifically its heir apparent Paul and his mother Jessica. The Atreides family was given the supposedly plum job of managing the desert planet Arrakis, which is the universe's only known source of this totally rad magical spice called ""melange."" Ingesting melange is kind of like snorting baby shark catiledge, except it makes you live forever, turns your eyes solid blue, and lets you see into the future.The problem is that this is all part of an elaborate ploy by the dude at the top of the feudal food chain to get rid of House Atreides, which was getting a little too big for its interstellar britches. Paul and his mother are soon on the run and fall in with the Fremen, the native people of Arrakis. They are are mysterious, twelve separate kinds of badass, and preocupied with drinking their own sweat. On top of all that, they also view Paul as some kind of messianic savior. Like Jesus, but with more roundhouse kicks. From there Paul both tries to engineer his revenge on his enemies and his reclamation (in all senses of the word) of the planet.I liked Dune because while it was straight up sci-fi space opera entertainment in some ways, Herbert built in a lot of subtle stuff, too. I particularly liked how Paul had to deal with the fact that he can fulfil the role of messiah to the Fremen natives, but his crazy ability to see the future tells him that if he's not careful that he'll ignite an intergalactic holy war, which is a wee bit more extreme than what he has in mind. There's also some cool stuff in there about how the prophecies about Paul were actually meticulously engineered whisper campaigns conducted by a sect that had been trying to produce someone like Paul through selective breeding and genetic engineering rather than something so mundane as divine intervention.So I like my introduction to Dune, and I plan to pick up subsequent books. I hear that all the ones that Frank Herbert himself wrote are good, but that I should stop before getting to the ones his son wrote after his father's death....more"

The worldbuilding is seamless, fascinating, and extremely convincing. Characters act in ways consistent with the strange new places Herbert explores, and these places are rough and wild. He's clearly thought through every little custom in every little faction of humanity, and they all trace their roots back to the reality of life on Arrakis. The trouble was, it is really, really, really hard to be invested in a slow-moving political history if you have no emotional connection with anybody, ever. Every single important character is next-level brilliant, with rigorous mental training so intense that we have scenes that are basically ""so-and-so's loved one had just died horribly, but they had to deal with the situation at hand, so they decided they'd react to that news later."" Which will naturally happen offscreen. Our protagonist falling in love and having a child? Offscreen. A character apparently sobbing behind closed doors about her dead husband? Offscreen. There were brief moments of emotion, but it felt like the book actively resisted any form of personal investment.Everyone has superhuman levels of control over their own emotions and behavior and superhuman skill at perceiving and predicting the thoughts and actions of others. I was never afraid for anybody, because they all seem so supremely adept at navigating situations and twisting them to a desired outcome. No one seemed morally upright enough for me to cheer for them except in a ""Well, I'm glad you're not the Baron"" sort of way. It's just layer upon layer upon layer of manipulation, archaic allegiances, and characters rearranging their own molecules so they can remain invincibly awesome.I realize that these characters are not meant to be relatable. Which is a fine thing to try to do, and clearly this story has worked for many, many people. Dune was not written for me, and judging by its incredible success, it shouldn't have been. But man, I STRUGGLED to get through this book. More riding-of-sandworms and less discussion of the political necessity of concubines, please....more"

I believe I would enjoy it even more back then. It was hardly D. Lynch's fault with ""Dune"" though , you can read its story in Lynch on Lynch. At the same time I remember playing strategy based PC Game ""Dune"" which kinda took me away from university class for a week or so (17 years ago, oh man...)What I would love to talk instead is why we like fantasy. I have to confess - even enjoying this book a lot I felt kind of shame. Like avoiding late work when deadline is near and you still looking for excuses not to do it. I felt like I'm spending my time on something I should not, and I know I would never feel anything like that reading Tolstoy for example. My next read will be Gamsun's ""Hunger"", that I took in my local library and I KNOW I won't feel guilty for reading the book, regardless of liking or not liking it. But I did feel that way reading ""Dune"" which I enjoyed a lot. Yes, this is totally neurotic reaction, I just wanna know if someone can share it with me.UPD: I just re-watched D.Lynch film (actually Alan Smithee film :) that's the name directors use when they don't want their name to appear in the credits). It actually starts off not that bad. While Lynch introduces characters, main themes, environments, while we see how that Harkonenns' trap catches Duke, everything is going on more then alright, but then IMO mr. Lynch runs against a problem of plot development. After reading the book I know that from the certain point whole drama more or less going on on sub-levels, inside new visions of Paul, inside his mother's body and etc. This is very hard if even possible to actually film such things in the movie. And because of that whole plot and characters development seems very scrappy and sometimes even goofy. If I was in the Lynch's place I would try to create my own plot mechanism, which would accumulate all cool Herbert details, instead of trying to project his literary visions on screen....more"

It is a very important planet within a galaxy wide empire of thousands; important for one simple reason. Melange, or Spice as itâs commonly referred to, is a drug that, whilst highly addictive, gives the consumer enhanced mental abilities. This planet is ruled by Baron Harkonnen, a harsh and tyrannical ruler who loses his position of power, due to the emperors request, to the Atreides lineage. This is all the backstory to the primary focus of the Duke Atreides son, Paul, evolving into a different style of life and environment and becoming a figure of legend and myth.Character development and description is somewhat unusual. The personality and psychology of all the characters is heavily learnt by other characters thoughts and emotions towards them; as well as their own of course. This can be take a little getting used to but works extremely well considering all the themes and ideas contained within the book. The range of characters and their interactions are a delight to read and something I personally love each and every time I read the book (I've read this a lot).The world of Dune is the main allure of the book; you get a real sense of this world existing and itâs people and ways of life. There is a real sense of history as well as cultural evolution and indeed revolution, bought more by events in the story. One standout part of the world is the Worms. They are a truly epic part of the plot and is culturally important; many films and books use Dune and the worms as inspiration.In Summary: An amazing SF novel and one that is crucially important both within the literary world and without it. Recommended for any Science Fiction or Fantasy (due to it reading very much like Fantasy) fan or anyone wanting to discover the cultural references of many a modern day film, book or game. A classic I think everyone should read simply put....more

A historical war against artificial intilligences has resulted in a law against advanced computers and technology. Personal force-field shields mean people fight with swords and knives. I spent much of the book wondering why Herbert didn't just make it a flat-out fantasy novel.I suppose it is a good fantasy novel, as fantasy novels go, but I wasn't much in the mood for one at the moment. Or ever, really - I've outgrown them. They're too simplistic. I have no interest in reading about pure good versus pure evil, a dichotomy which Dune was often leaning towards in spite of the protagonist's fears that he might inadvertently launch a bloody jihad. Take the antagonists, for example: the cruel and evil House Harkonnen, which keeps slaves, encourages oppression, and is ruled over by a fat and corpulent Duke who also happens to be a pedophile. That's just lazy. Nor do endless political machinations particularly intrigue me.I know it's unfair to compare this to the Wheel of Time series, since that was written twenty-five years later and was clearly ripping off Dune rather than the other way round, but that was the vibe I was getting. Which is bad, because Wheel of Time is bad. As well as the aforementioned political schemes and court intrigue, the're another similar (identical, really) element that will be obvious to anyone who's read both books: the Fremen and the Aiel. Both of them are hardcore, badass desert tribes with byzantine cultures who personify freedom and the joy of life; a modern take on the noble savage. And in both books the author repeatedly beats you about the head with how HARDCORE and BADASS they are. It's a little weird. (It's also further evidence that Robert Jordan never had an original idea in his head, as if we didn't know that already).For such a classic and renowned work of science fiction, I found Dune to be a disappointment. Oh well. At least the video game was awesome. ...more

After finishing the book, I'm pretty sure I will come back to this book at a later time and give it the care and nurturing it needs in order to fully appreciate it. Now that we've put that out there, let's move on to my initial thoughts.For me, this was a form of world building that I haven't really encountered before. There were a lot of terms, beliefs, ways of communicating, and societies that were brand new in a way I haven't read in other fantasy world-building books. I felt that the way everyone interacted with each other was extremely formal, which seemed strange to me. Not turned off by it, just different. My favorite character by far is the Duke Leto, Paul's father. He has a sense of integrity about him, but is also intelligent enough to know others don't play by the rules and thereby counter-attacks their attempts. The story is told by multiple perspectives, but not so many that you get confused. My confusion lay in a lot of the terminology, which there is a glossary provided in the back of the book for most of the terms. I feel if I concentrated my attention on this book solely instead of reading multiple books as well, I would've been more immersed in this world. I could see and read the potential, but I wasn't as absorbed in it as I was with The Way of Kings. If you're wanting to find a book to introduce yourself into the sci-fi genre, this isn't the book. If you love sci-fi literature and really want to see where the genre built upon itself, this is a great book to choose. Ironically, it doesn't necessarily have a lot of the technological machines that you would usually expect in a sci-fi book, but it is much closer to sci-fi than it is to fantasy, in my opinion. It's a dense book, but I believe it's a book worth reading (and reading again if you don't quite understand it). Check out my other reviews at https://missymaysreadingnook.blogspot......more

It is really that intelligent, complex, suspenseful and imaginative. For this alone Dune is among the best books I ever read.The story follows the young Paul Atreides' coming of age and the events that either will make him a messiah or a corpse. He is for the most part of the story such a charming protagonist, except for the inexplicable rages he flies into, when his friends/family are trying to help him out. But to his enemies he is cool and levelheaded. Bizarre. Beside him there is a large cast of engaging characters that grow and develop.However, there are some minor quibbles too, like the implausible ending scenes. It is also very slow and repetitive. The book is best suited for readers who take the time and effort to delve into its themes and characters. And the writing style makes sure, that it takes a very long time to get into the story.For me an annoying part of the book was the repetitive esoteric rhetoric. It was so interesting at first, but the very same thing got mentioned and explained so many times, it became a hateful subject. And I didn't care much for the high level of anxiety many characters had. It is very well to be anxious and careful when dealing with intrigue, and it is true that a single detail can decide the outcome of a difficult situation. But here everyone was constantly jumping to the worst possible and often wholly unrelated conclusion in a single bound (especially Jessica). Along the lines: Oh no, he tied his shoes with his left hand and not with both hands, this means we are all going to die this instant.But as i said those are minor drawbacks.

As I was reading, I was reminded of the way other Western writers have interlaced their prose with Islamic references and Arabic naming conventions (Jorge Luis Borges and H.P. Lovecraft were the first two that came to mind) and how it creates a sort of exotic mystique for those of us not born or bred in the Middle East. And then I read this Scientific American article about how the current war in Syria is largely a result of improper water usage (The Ominous Story of Syria's Climate Refugees) and suddenly Dune seemed like a Nostradamus prediction made 40 years ago! Herbet builds a fascinating universe that brings into question everything from power to religion and politics while highlighting our tendency to make unsustainable our own environment in the pursuit of shorter term desires (or, just plain greed)....more

Not a hint of humor, never a sign that the world is something to enjoy.Reading this book, I became lost in a storm that held little meaning and emotion for me. Then, I decided.

I feel it is a must read for anyone interested in the inner workings of humanity, and most especially for SciFi lovers.  Dune is rife with insight, observation and wisdom of a depth we seldom experience. Upon completing all 15 books of the Dune saga, I found it to be the single most satisfying conclusion to a series I have ever encountered. Rarely do we get such satisfaction in series. Most times, I find my interest waning as each book in a series gets a little more dull than the last, as if the author is trying too hard to re-create the excitement of the first book. This was not the case with the Dune novels. I hope you'll give it a try because it really is one of the best series ever written. Originally thought to be 'too epic', the publication of Dune in 1965 has changed the face of ScifFi forever.  Dune is the single most purchased SciFi book of all time and worthy of the position it holds as my favorite book of all time....more

But Dune itself, the germ of the series and of two movies, is excellent!Space opera is an old subgenre in science fiction, the usual model being the Roman Empire imposed on some star system or galaxy as, for instance, Asimov's Foundation (another interminable series which has outlived its author). What Herbert did that was different was to change the model from classical antiquity in the West to Arabian jihadists conquering it and to add strong, prescient doses of altered states of consciousness and of planetary ecology. All of this is united within a religious vision both rich and attractive despite its remoteness to us culturally, spatially and temporally. Truly a brilliant work!Visually, David Lynch's film version captures some of the rich texture of the novel and some of the enthusiastic religious spirit conveyed by it, but, like any movie, it disappoints by setting down, hard and fast, one single interpetation. If you haven't seen the movie(s) or read the book, read the book first, then watch the longest version of the Lynch film to see how he tries to handle it....more

419185250	234225	2012-09-21	5	No matter how many times I reread this, Dune doesn't disappoint. Frank Herbert was a master of worldbuilding, and his prose effortlessly captures the reader and brings the story alive. So many issues - ecology and politics, genetics and religion, myth and time - factor into Herbert's analysis of what it means to be human. This is, simply put, one of the greatest works of the science fiction tradition.
1840420680	234225	2016-12-24	4	"The start is one of the slowest beginnings I've found, and the writing could be much better than the rather basic prose Herbert exhibits, but the storyline and the setting are quite good once one gets past the first ""book"" in the this first installment of the Dune saga. I enjoyed the plot and the worldbuilding more than the characters, enough to want to continue with the rest to see how the story of the Atreides family will pan out."
469755605	234225	2012-12-04	3	I really enjoyed the way Frank Herbert transported me into a different time and place so completely. The way he built the world of Arrakis in my imagination was so detailed. Once the setting was established I ate up every fantastic scene until the story became more of a war tale than a science fiction novel. The length of the novel slowed how quickly I turned the pages and I just lost interest in the epic battle by the end.
1824285165	234225	2016-12-28	5	Very much still a journey beyond imagination, and in this case brought to life by Simon Vance and a diverse cast of narrators.Probably enjoyed it even more this time 'round than when I first read it more than 20 years ago.If you haven't read this yet, do yourself a massive favour and consume it NOW before Arrival's Denis Villeneuve does a new film version and blows all our minds.

I've been a fan of the film for decades (that's a classic too) and where the film had diverged from the book turned out to be quite a surprise. A pleasant one, of course. Brilliant book.

What a shame that the rest of the series spiralled down into incomprehensibility.

Me han gustado la ambientaciÃ³n y las intrigas, pero el modo en que estÃ¡ escrito me ha resultado innecesariamente enrevesado y complicado y creo que por eso no he conseguido conectar mÃ¡s con la historia.

The story was great, although it felt a little too religious for me from time to time (but seriously, I'm allergic to that, so it probably won't bother you). This book probably taught me more about politics and psychology than I ever learned in school.

Still one of the best science fiction novels Iâve read to date.â ~The Founding FieldsThere are a select few big-name SFF authors from the somewhat mid to late 1900s that I consider to be a must read for any fan of the genres. These include greats like Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, and Frank Herbert, J. R. R. Tolkien, Raymond E. Feist. The reason for that is that these three men wrote the novels I read in my formative years of breaking into the âproperâ SF genre. From grades 9-12, it was Arthur C. Clarkeâs Odyssey series, Frank Herbertâs Dune Chronicles, and Isaac Asimovâs Robot and Foundation novels that I kept returning to again and again. They enhanced my love of reading and opened me up to some truly wonderful worlds and settings that I could get lost in again and again, without any of the charm dimming.Last year, I powered through the audiobooks for the first five Dune Chronicles novels and I was reminded of why I loved this series, and why I hold Dune to be the most phenomenal science fiction novel written to date, in my experience. There are some truly wonderful authors writing SF today, such as Adam Christopher, Rob Sanders, Nick Kyme, Graham McNeill, James Swallow, Kevin J. Anderson, Mike Stackpole, Nathan Long, Paul S. Kemp, Drew Karpyshyn, Guy Haley, Matt Forbeck, Gav Thorpe, Selso Xisto, Jo Anderton, Sarah Cawkwell, Katy Stauber, and others. But, for nostalgic charm, and just the huge scope of world-building that can be found in Frank Herbertâs Dune, there is no compare.(Note: To head-off any readers raging about the male vs female argument in my list above, I havenât read that much SF from female authors, and Iâm just going by that experience. I tend to read more fantasy than SF from female authors. The list above is not meant to be restrictive in any way.)If anyone asks me which SF novel I would absolutely recommend above all others, my first response would be Dune. If you havenât read it yet, then you have missed out on some fantastic characters, exceptional story-telling, and great SF/space opera elements.I make no secret of the fact that I love the entirety of the Dune-verse. Iâve read all the six volumes penned by Frank Herbert himself. Iâve read the seventh volume co-written by his son Brian Herbert and noted SF author Kevin J. Anderson. Iâve also read the prequel House and Legends of Dune trilogies by the duo. And I love all of them. None of these novels are perfect (although Dune comes close), and they all have a few flaws, but the entire scope of the setting, the daring concepts and themes that they all explore is nothing short of fascinating. And itâs that vision that I respect above all other elements of these books. Without that vision, none of these books would have been as great as they are.So, on to Dune itself.There is no one factor that stands out on its own above any of the others for this book. Thereâs a very perfect harmony between all the elements of the book, whether itâs the pacing, or the characters, or the world-building, or the dialogue, or anything else. Of course, the characters are a special bunch all the same.Whether itâs Duke Leto Atreides, or Lady Jessica, or Paul, or Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, or Stilgar, or Count Fenring, or Feyd-Rautha, or any of the other characters, each and every one of them brings something different to the table. The thing is that through the entirety of the cast, we get to see the Imperium almost in its entirety, both on a meta level, and a more personal one. We see how the various noble Houses struggle against each other; how the Padishah Emperorâs elite troops, the Imperial Sardaukar, measure up against the armies of other noble Houses and the desert warriors of Dune, the Fremen; we see how politics can adversely affect a noble House from within; we see how the lowliest of all the people in the Imperium survive; we see the strategies and plots and counters of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood in effect; we see how the Guild Navigators fit into the social and cultural strata of the Imperium; and more.The journey of Paul Atreides from his times as a young boy on Caladan, through his years on Dune as Paul Muadâdib, and to the culmination of this journey as Duke Paul Atreides, is the central narrative of Dune. Everything revolves around the desert planet, and Paulâs life on it is intrinsically tied to its fate. Through Paul, and other characters such as the Imperial Planetologist Liet Kynes and the Fremen Naib (leader) Stilgar, we see how the Fremen intend to change the face of planet for the future generations, redefining their relationship with it over the course of decades, and even centuries. Paulâs introduction into the grand schemes of the Fremen is an important element of the second half of the novel, because he doesOnce again, itâs Frank Herbertâs immense scope and vision thatâs at work here. The novel is incredibly detailed and it touches on a plethora of social, cultural, economic, and environmental issues, many of which are just as relevant today as they were for the author in the 1960s. One of the things that I really liked about the novel, in relation to the above, is that whenever Herbert talks about Imperial technology, or the atmospheric conditions on Dune and the effects of the geriatric spice, melange, the novel takes on a very âHard SFâ feel. And itâs not presented in the dull factual way that Greg Egan does in his Orthogonal space opera series, or how Mike Stackpole describes starfighter flight mechanics in his X-wing novels. Herbertâs descriptions are much more approachable and easy to grasp. He has a facility with describing complex topics such as the relationship between the sandworms of Dune and the planet itself, and how this relationship affects the entirety environment conditions on the planet, plus, how this in turn affects living conditions in the desert regions. For this reason alone the novel gets a huge thumbs-up from me....more

Summary of my review, without spoilers: This is novel is a classic of Sci-Fi and should be, because it's world-building is exquisite, incredible, and inspiring.That said, as with most classics, we should examine it with a critical eye.Rooting for the well-crafted world of Arrakis serves to mask how ambivalent the reader is towards rooting for Paul and Jessica.The problematic aspects of this novel are cringe-worthy and reveal that this book is out-dated.Spoilers ahead.THE GOOD: World-Building. World. Building.Frank Herbert is an incredible world-builder. I have seen few novels that have achieved a feat of world-building so absolutely incredible and encompassing. The Bene Gesserit, the religions, the political structure and history, the expression of past, present, and future, are breath-taking. As, too, the appendices help to reveal, a mind-numbing amount of thought and work and imagination went into the building of the world that allowed for Dune and its philosophies, characters, and plot points. It's for this reason in particular that I can see Dune as a foundational, inspirational text for Science Fiction as well as Fantasy. The seemingly effortless explanations of this world and what helps to form and create it, who its people are, how, and why, is just absolutely intensely impressive. The fremen, the sand-worms, the politics and the schemes, alliances and treacheries and the histories they eschew. THE BAD THOUGH:Connective FailingsAgainst the backdrop of Frank Herbert's incredible world has to be a plot and characters. An immediate set. I never found a reason to like Paul, although I'm not sure if I'm supposed to. He knows all and we have a sense that this child will soon be orphaned and then a savior of sorts as prophecized. When the moment comes that Paul gains all knowledge of the future, however, it's a little anti-climactic. The exploration of what it means to see the future is intriguing and well done, but Paul as a character ends up unfeeling and unsympathetic. Like Paul himself says-with his knowledge comes a change to love and hate. This applies to the reader, because once Paul becomes knowledgable, I felt like I stopped rooting for him and instead just tried to follow the crazy twists and turns of his logic. There is a similar problem with Jessica, who somehow does not come across with any real feeling due to her own more expansive knowledge. I found myself only liking side characters--Halleck, Hawat, Chani--because I felt they had some feelings that I could like. I was never rooting for Paul or Jessica. I was only ever rooting for Arrakis and the fremen. The world. And here we are, back to the best part being the world-building.Problematic Early Sci-Fi WomenAre there strong women in this novel? In my opinion, eh. I feel like the ending [ending sentence spoiler ahead] provides part of my reasoning. Jessica says to Chani [the two main women characters of the novel]: ""See that princess standing there, so haughty and confident. They say she has pretensions of a literary nature. Let us hope she finds solace in such things; she'll have little else...Think on it, Chani: that princess will have the name, yet she'll live as less than a concubine--never to know a moment of tenderness from the man to whom she's bound. While we, Chani, we who carry the name of concubine--history will call us wives."" I have so many problems with this sentence, let alone with what it says about their role in the rest of the novel, that I don't quite even know where to begin. Sarcasm activate. Oh good. So this novel isn't focused on concubines, then, a maniacal focus on illegitimate relationships and women who want to but can never marry their loved ones, instead it focuses on how they're WIVES. There are a thousand and one ways to remember Jessica, for one. A Reverend Mother, a fremen leader, a mother, THE mother of St. Alia and the Muad'Dib, an incredible Bene Gesserit woman with incredible capacities, etc, etc, etc. But no, she reassures her now concubine-to-Paul friend that they will be remembered as wives, as opposed to that other woman who apparently has nothing to live for because she'll only be Paul's wife and get no love from her husband. We have mothers and wives, emphasis on the wives. Women in this novel are defined by their relationship to men, who are given all the power. The novel itself has the power to take that away. The novel gives Jessica and Chani tremendous influence and the potential for fantastic power, intelligence, and leadership, it shows them take it, and then it dismisses them by pretending that being remembered as a wife is what makes them powerful. It even ends on that note, leading me to believe that Herbert really did believe that sentence meant something powerful and wonderful for women. When Jessica and Chani are not women defined by men, they are women defined by their connection to their religion, and Jessica is often called a witch, not to mention the married-to-religion/giving mother trope.Oh, and don't remind me about the woman Paul wins at the beginning of his fremen encounter.The closest we get to an independent woman is St. Alia, and the closest we get for her is the ""Saint"" in her title, which we only get from the appendix: in the novel she is either pitied and called a monster for knowing too much too early, or is a feared murderous child-woman. The other closest is the fremen woman who greets Jessica, becomes her servant, gives her a crysknife, and then quickly dies before she can become more important.Problematic Early Sci-Fi HomophobiaIt appears only briefly, but it's a trope and one I do feel I need to point out following my discussion of the women of the novel. The Baron likes men, or more specifically, he likes young boy slaves, almost all of which die or are turned into weapons by his son in the novel, which is unfortunately a classic trope. Villain likes young boys, he is clearly twisted, has twisted tastes, this is further proof of his twisted-ness, gay men are twisted, also evil. ...more"

The lack of moral sophistication or subjective depth in the hero/villain contrast is laughable at best; the antagonist is a sadistic pedophile cartoon character whose beef with the hero isn't ever explained. As a matter of fact, I didn't find myself caring about a single character in this book. The book is filled with racist, Orientalist nonsense. The main plotline is a white savior cliche. Criticisms of this book appear to be often met with condescending assumptions about the reader's ability to understand the complex story or the sophisticated prose. I find these defenses of the book incredible, because the plot is actually quite straightforward and simple, and the prose couldn't be more direct. It's written at an 8th grade level. I am totally baffled by this book's popularity. I can honestly say I find it to be the most overrated book I've ever read....more

165121214	234225	2011-05-02	3	I'm editing this review to ask a general question. Is it possible that Herbert had Asperger's syndrome? Almost of the emotions characters have in the books are basic primal emotions, fear, hunger, thirst, anxiety, exhaustion, relief, anger, greed, but when the characters relate to each other, there is very little emotional exchange. If a characters husband, child, family, wife, dies it's essentially glossed over. A possible exception might be Yueh, but you never actually get see him interact witI'm editing this review to ask a general question. Is it possible that Herbert had Asperger's syndrome? Almost of the emotions characters have in the books are basic primal emotions, fear, hunger, thirst, anxiety, exhaustion, relief, anger, greed, but when the characters relate to each other, there is very little emotional exchange. If a characters husband, child, family, wife, dies it's essentially glossed over. A possible exception might be Yueh, but you never actually get see him interact with his wife while she's alive. Oh sure, you might be told that a character 'is sad' or 'has been crying' or 'wants revenge' for the loss of a loved one but you never see them actually feel these things. In fact, I think Channi may have been the only character that I sensed any true affectionate actions from (and towards Paul even, who...truth be told...is a bit of a spoiled asshat in my opinion), and even then they're muted. Anyway, just a thought I had, I'll carry on reviewing now...MINOR SPOILERS AHEADPeople I know and respect have read Dune and they rave about how good it is. I put off reading it for years for no good reason, then the time came and I figured...this will be a sure winner and I'm digging back into the sci fi genre lately, it's time. I really wanted to like this book. I expected an amazing read. I was sorely disappointed. I'm really torn about scoring the story. I want to give this book 3.5 stars, but the stupid 5 star system limits me. Rather than rounding up, I'm rounding down for a few reasons. First, I really had to force myself to slog through the book. Not because the writing was difficult, but because the characters were not compelling or likable. The two people I liked the most were both killed relatively early on and I never really warmed to the rest of them. It really says something when a primary character's young child is killed and I found myself not even blinking, nor caring. I CRY AT HALLMARK COMMERCIALS FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE! Hell, I've cried during Star Trek movies. (Of course, the fact that the character didn't really bat much of an eye about the situation probably didn't help. How can you find empathy for a character that virtually shrugs off that kind of thing?)Second, (and I apologize to the hardcore Dune fans out there) I got the impression that Herbert BELIEVES himself to be a deep, awesome philosopher. He's not. Not in my opinion, anyway. I could kind of see where he was going a most of the time, but he frequently overdoes it without actually making sense. It was quiet irritating, to be honest. Third, Herbert's characters analyze every damn thing to a level of minutia that is irritating. Yes, yes, I get it...the sisters and fighters and lords, etc must analyze things to understand motivations for other's actions and to try to out-think them, but sometimes it just gets tedious. The tiniest actions, from an inhaled breath or a quickened pulse or a glance is looked at three ways to Sunday for hidden meaning. Dude, I get it already... Fourth, I think this book is overrated and needs a few harsher reviews to 'even out' the multitude of fivers. Not because I feel any animosity toward the book or even those reviews, but mainly because I think it's fair to warn others that this might not be the genre's magnus opus they have been told to expect. (I realize I'm misusing the phrase magnus opus, but it's 3:36AM and I'm not in the mood to find a better term.)Finally, I found the motivations for some character's actions either didn't make sense or were contradictory. I'm a bit in a rush to get this posted, or I'd go into it, but suffice to say that this is especially true for Paul and Jessica in the middle of the book. Now, with all that negativity, there were some amazing things in this book. Herbert is obviously a master world builder. The universe he created has more depth, breadth, novelty and complexity that you usually encounter in your average sci-fi book. I can certainly see why people call him one of the great fathers of science fiction. To have been written in 1965? Simply amazing! If he could just have made me love the characters as much as I loved his universe, this would have been a solid 5 star review. I enjoyed the complex use of language as well. There were words that you don't hear used often these days, good words, that are casually thrown around. Beautiful words like saturnine and cleverly made up words like ornithopter, onomonopoedic words to describe a thing. It was refreshing! I also greatly enjoyed the political and religious maneuvering that was explored. Much like the Song of Ice and Fire series by George R.R. Martin, the politics and religions are almost characters unto themselves, driving the plot as much as the individuals. I enjoyed it as much as the physical aspect of the world building.I'm going to give Dune Messiah a chance because of the world building, but I don't have high hopes for finishing the series. Usually, when I complete the first book in a series I like, I'm anxious to find out what happens to the characters. I love that feeling of reuniting with good friends. In Dune's case, though, I'm simply interested in knowing what happens to the planet and the universe. In fact, I found myself not caring if any of the characters made it to the end of the last book...much less continue on in the next one...but the world? THAT I find fascinating....more
